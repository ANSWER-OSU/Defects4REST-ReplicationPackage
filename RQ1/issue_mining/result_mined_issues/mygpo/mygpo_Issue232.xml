  <TITLE>Recognize CC licenses with https URLs</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>https://gpodder.net/directory/+license contains a list of licenses. When selecting a license the podcasts that use this particular license are shown. In https://github.com/gpodder/mygpo/blob/1950aae95d79c87bf703ec7f457fd84c2c9613f4/mygpo/web/utils.py#L204 the license URLs are matched against known patterns to show &quot;nice&quot; names instead of URLs. For creative commons licenses, only http URLs are recognized. http and https URLs should be recognized as identical.</DESCRIPTION>
