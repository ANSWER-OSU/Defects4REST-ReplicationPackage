  <TITLE>Wrong HTTP verb semantics around file creation</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>According to [the README](https://github.com/chrislusf/weed-fs#write-file), the /assign request is a &quot;GET&quot;, but performing this &quot;GET&quot; _creates_ a space for a file. HTTP GET actions are supposed to only be used for actions that _do not modify state_ (ie. they can be cached, and a spider re-requesting them thousands of times a second won't have any effect other than a transient increase in server load). The /assign request should be a POST, as it _creates_ something. This avoids intermediate components breaking things by making assumptions about the behavior of GET requests (ie. a caching layer not forwarding the GET request to the server). (Reading [the further API documentation](https://github.com/chrislusf/weed-fs/blob/master/docs/api.rst), this also applies to `/vol/vacuum`, `/vol/grow`, and `/admin/assign_volume`. GET is an appropriate verb for `/dir/lookup`, `/cluster/status`, `/dir/status`, and `/status`.) Similarly, the requests to upload file content are &quot;POST&quot; requests, but they should be &quot;PUT&quot; requests, as they are replayable to _restore_ state.</DESCRIPTION>
