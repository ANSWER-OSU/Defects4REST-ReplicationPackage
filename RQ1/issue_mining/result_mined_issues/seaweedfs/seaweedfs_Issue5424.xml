  <TITLE>Credentials leaking in logs</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** It's not a bug but more a small security issue. When a database connection fails for `filer`, the credentials are logged into the console. For instance, I have set up a test deployment with a Postgres. In case of a connection error to the DB, the username and password are logged into the console as plain test. This is not a critical thing, so it could be done with any upcoming release, I guess. **System Setup** Any running `filer` with an external database (postgres in this case), which cannot connect to the DB. For instance provide an unreachable IP or something like this. **Expected behavior** I would suggest to either not log the `password` at all, or log it with `debug` or `trace` level only, so it would normally not show up. **Screenshots** ![grafik](https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/assets/62848396/fad3f51f-8b8e-4381-96c6-c9a4ad92e27f)</DESCRIPTION>
