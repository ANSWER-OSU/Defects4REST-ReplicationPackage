  <TITLE>[Mount] Unable to start mount</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** I just updated to commit 2b13d2c083a8cf2e1efc616e3301ce590c78cf11 and mount refuses to start anymore. This is the error: ``` I0917 11:11:23.922805 needle_map_leveldb.go:67 Loading /mnt/seaweedfs/.docker/cloud_edge/48101edc/c2_2_1.ldb... , watermark: 0 I0917 11:11:23.923168 leveldb_store.go:47 filer store dir: /mnt/seaweedfs/.docker/cloud_edge/48101edc/meta I0917 11:11:23.923198 file_util.go:27 Folder /mnt/seaweedfs/.docker/cloud_edge/48101edc/meta Permission: -rwxr-xr-x I0917 11:11:23.931053 wfs_filer_client.go:31 WithFilerClient 0 vpn.katapy.icu:18888: filer: no entry is found in filer store I0917 11:11:23.942884 wfs_filer_client.go:31 WithFilerClient 1 lh1.vpn.katapy.icu:18888: filer: no entry is found in filer store failed to start background tasks: filer: no entry is found in filer store ``` My guess is it is related to the new WORM patch which added: https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/blob/2b13d2c083a8cf2e1efc616e3301ce590c78cf11/weed/mount/weedfs.go#L144 ``` fn, err := wfs.subscribeFilerConfEvents() if err != nil { return err } go fn() ``` The **remote** filer has data ( tested connecting with shell ) but the **local** filer store used for cache, that is created new, is empty with version change on a new folder, has no data and I think this causes the mount to crash. **System Setup** Commit 2b13d2c083a8cf2e1efc616e3301ce590c78cf11 **Expected behavior** Weed should run normally as before **Additional context** I am going to locally test removing the return error that is causing in my opinion the mount to not work anymore</DESCRIPTION>
