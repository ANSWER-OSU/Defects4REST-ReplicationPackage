  <TITLE>[feature request] auto retry for `volume.fix.replication` and `volumeServer.evacuate`</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>When the network is not exactly 100% stable, these two commands may fail mid-way and abort without the operator noticing anything. It would be nice if they can at least attempt to retry the failed operation at least once before aborting.</DESCRIPTION>
