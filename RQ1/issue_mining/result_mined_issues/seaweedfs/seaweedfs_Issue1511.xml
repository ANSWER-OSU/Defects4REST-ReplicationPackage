  <TITLE>S3 Ability to disable listing on a bucket</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** I want seaweedfs to serve read-only files by link, which is a Read operation. But also I wish to disable the ability of a non-authorized user to get file listing in a bucket. Currently it seems to be impossible. Could this be implemented somehow?</DESCRIPTION>
