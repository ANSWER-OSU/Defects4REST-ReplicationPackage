  <TITLE>The bucket naming rules conflict when docking with minio</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>When uploading buckets through java minio, minio prompts me that the buckets to be transferred do not conform to the naming rules of S3 buckets My bucket name is 10000_ test However, it cannot be used in the S3 naming specification_ To name it. aws-cli passed the name, but the seaweedfs server did not verify the bucket name So I suggest checking the incoming bucket name on the seeweedfs server to ensure that the system has stronger compatibility</DESCRIPTION>
