  <TITLE>how to build weed-fs binaries</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I'd like to build the latest from master, but not sure of a simple way to do that. I had hoped I could do something like this (in the docker registry [here](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/golang/)): ``` git clone https://github.com/chrislusf/weed-fs.git cd weed-fs docker run --rm -it -v &quot;$PWD&quot;:/usr/src/weed -w /usr/src/weed golang:1.4.1-cross bash $ for GOOS in darwin linux; do &gt; for GOARCH in 386 amd64; do &gt; go build -v -o myapp-$GOOS-$GOARCH &gt; done &gt; done ``` But it fails I think due to the directory structure of the Go files for this project. Any guidance on how to build my own binaries from master would be greatly appreciated!</DESCRIPTION>
