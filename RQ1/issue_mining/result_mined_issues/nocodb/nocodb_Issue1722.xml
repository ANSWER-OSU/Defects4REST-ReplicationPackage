  <TITLE>Can't access projects since upgrade to 0.90.0</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, I just tried upgrading NocoDB from 0.84.16 to 0.90.0 using `docker-compose pull`, and I'm experiencing some issues. When I loaded NocoDB in my browser the first time after the upgrade, I got presented with the Sign Up page, but I mindlessly entered my login info (that was already in the database) and clicked &quot;Sign Up&quot;, not realizing it was not the login page. At that point, I got redirected to my project list, like if I had just logged in. The problem is that now every project I try to open fails to load with the message: &quot;Error: Request failed with status code 403&quot;. Did I just break something in my account info? I'm guessing this might be a problem with the data in the database, don't hesitate to ask for contents of tables if needed. Thanks for the awesome work on NocoDB, I'm really enjoying it! **Steps To Reproduce** 1. Upgrade from version 0.84.16 using `docker-compose pull &amp;&amp; docker-compose up --build -d` 2. Go to NocoDB URL 3. Fill the sign up form with information already found in the database and submit form 4. Try to load any project 5. See error about HTTP 403 **Expected behavior** Be able to load projects NocoDB used as docker : true NocoDB version : 0.90.0 Database used in NC_DB URL : mysql Project was created by clicking : New Project by connecting to external database Database on which spreadsheet is created : mysql OS on which NocoDB is running : Docker on Ubuntu Server 20.04.4 LTS Database version : MariaDB 10.7.3</DESCRIPTION>
