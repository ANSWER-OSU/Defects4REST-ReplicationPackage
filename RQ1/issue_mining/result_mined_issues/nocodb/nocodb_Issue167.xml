  <TITLE>&quot;Save&quot; needs to be way more visible</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>It took me a long time to realize why my data was not saved between refreshes. It should be made much more visible that the user must click Save, or their data will be lost. There should also be a native warning popup on tab close.</DESCRIPTION>
