  <TITLE>Bug: inactive trigger doesn't change to active.</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Please confirm that the bug report does ***not*** already exist - [x] I confirm there is no existing issue for this bug. ### Steps to reproduce 1. Create a trigger on any other type of webhook but manual 2. Change to inactive 3. Edit the type to manual trigger I get that the toggle must be disabled, but keeping it inactive doesn't show on the list that can be choose in the button field in the &quot;Run webhook&quot; mode ### Desired Behavior The most simple solution should be that the webhook should change to active when is updated to manual trigger. If is expected that active status should also filter in the button list, then the active toggle should also be able to change for manual trigger, otherwise if shouldn't be a filter, the list shouldn't filter if the webhook was marked as unactive. ### Project Details Node: **v22.14.0** Arch: **x64** Platform: **linux** Docker: **true** RootDB: **pg** PackageVersion: **0.262.5** ### Attachments _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
