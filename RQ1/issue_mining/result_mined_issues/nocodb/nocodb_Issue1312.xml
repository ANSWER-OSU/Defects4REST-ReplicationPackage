  <TITLE>Changing single select fields results in webhooks getting called twice</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Node: **v12.22.6** Arch: **x64** Platform: **linux** Docker: **true** Database: **pg** ProjectOnRootDB: **true** RootDB: **pg** PackageVersion: **0.84.12** **Steps To Reproduce** I've set up an ON UPDATE + condition webhook (URL). (when a field is set to true execute POST call) But for some reason, it always executes twice. i.e. I get 2 calls executed for a single update. Only 1 webhook is being used throughout the whole organization (there were more previously which I've removed). Not sure what it does but clicked on &quot;reload&quot; as well. **Expected behavior** Webhook is only executed once for a single row update **Screenshots** https://i.imgur.com/4rGpHg6.png</DESCRIPTION>
