  <TITLE>Controlled vocabulary/ontology for Meta info (formally Normalization) for use with NER</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** Right now it is not possible to have a user normalize/link a named entity to a term from a controlled vocabulary/dictionary/ontology. This is useful for linking a named entity (say a disease) to a specific term within a medical ontology. **Describe the solution you'd like** The ability to upload an ontology file (for example .obo) that can be associated with a specific project. The ontology would then autocomplete for users populating the Meta info attribute of a named entity allowing them to choose only a term from the specific ontology/dictionary. **Describe alternatives you've considered** The alternative would be to ask users to complete the Meta info field by searching from an external website and populating with the term. This does not allow the project to enforce that the term come from a specific ontology or properly version the ontology.</DESCRIPTION>
