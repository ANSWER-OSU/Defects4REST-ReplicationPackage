  <TITLE>Add the ability to hide all relations at once</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** Our team usually hides all relationships to then enable them one by one to view their relation. This was available in past versions but seems to have gotten removed in more recent versions. (there was an eye-icon next to the relationships tab title) **Describe the solution you'd like** An eye icon that - hides all relationships when pressed - unhides all relationships when pressed (when one or more relationships were hidden manually) **Describe alternatives you've considered** Hiding all of the relationships one by one. **Additional context** ![image](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/assets/11699918/538858c8-8283-4911-9d2d-fb67b3dfe4e3)</DESCRIPTION>
