  <TITLE>Typo in an example on the Storage page</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION># Bug report &lt;!-- ⚠️ We receive a lot of bug reports which have already been solved or discussed. If you are looking for help, please try these first: - Docs: https://docs.supabase.com - Discussions: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions - Discord: https://discord.supabase.com Before opening a bug report, please verify the following: --&gt; - [ x] I confirm this is a bug with Supabase, not with my own application. - [ x] I confirm I have searched the [Docs](https://docs.supabase.com), GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions), and [Discord](https://discord.supabase.com). ## Describe the bug On the bottom of https://supabase.com/storage, the last example in the last tab has a copy-paste error from the tab before it. I do not think this is correct, it should be something more akin of &quot;all authenticated users have access to the bucket&quot;, the folder name is not defined in the example, unlike in the previous tab where it is. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aba7844-5473-4d4c-8446-36ffb53d6f67)</DESCRIPTION>
