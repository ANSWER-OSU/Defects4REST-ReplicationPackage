  <TITLE>auth event &quot;SIGNED_IN&quot; triggers on tab change (unexpected behavior)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION># Improve documentation https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-onauthstatechange ## Describe the problem Auth event `SIGNED_IN` fires when you change to another tab and back. @silentworks mentioned that this is &quot;expected behavior&quot; (https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/7250) This does not match the label `SIGNED_IN`. The label suggests that a user (who was not previously signed in) signs in. Otherwise, you would also expect `SIGNED_OUT` to trigger when tabs are changed. The existence of `INITIAL_SESSION` does not make this any clearer. ## Describe the improvement I propose one of two changes: 1. Change the label `SIGNED_IN` to something else that provides a clearer intent of the event. But this may introduce breaking changes. 2. Add clarification in the documentation as to when `SIGNED_IN` actually fires, since the label itself is unclear.</DESCRIPTION>
