  <TITLE>README of zh-TW is being translated into zh-CN</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION># Improve documentation ## Link https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/i18n/README.zh-tw.md ## Describe the problem As title, the zh-TW translation is being translated into zh-CN. It seems that #14359 has modified the translation files using DeepL, a machine learning translation service. However, it only supports Simplified Chinese, but not Traditional Chinese. Also, from the repo the issue mentioned, the translated file only contains [README.zh.md](https://github.com/lyqht/deepL-demo/blob/master/docs/supabase/README.zh.md), which is Simplified Chinese. ## Describe the improvement Manually translate the zh-TW one, as DeepL seems to fail the job. ## Additional context DeepL only supports Simplified Chinese (简体中文), but not Traditional Chinese (繁體中文). &lt;img width=&quot;336&quot; alt=&quot;DeepL&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/supabase/supabase/assets/18496305/602ee42f-7055-4d4b-8c0b-91a2aae7c594&quot;&gt;</DESCRIPTION>
