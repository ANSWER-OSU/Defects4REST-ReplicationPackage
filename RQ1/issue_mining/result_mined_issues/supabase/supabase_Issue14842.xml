  <TITLE>NextJS - Getting Started can't find types</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION># Improve documentation There is no reference given to get the database types in NextJS Getting Started Docs for Typescript ## Link [Getting Started - NextJS](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-nextjs) ## Describe the problem I was trying the `Getting Started` guide on NextJS with Typescript and I came across a database type that is not mentioned anywhere in the guide. ![Database types missing](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/assets/89470104/f3110ac4-e7a3-4e2b-be89-bbd78222003e) But after some research, I found the page in the docs ## Describe the improvement To mention in the docs that if you are using TypeScript refer to the link to [generate Database types](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/rest/generating-types) So searching for the types won't be a hassle for new learners. ## Additional context I want to work on the issue and improve the documentation.</DESCRIPTION>
