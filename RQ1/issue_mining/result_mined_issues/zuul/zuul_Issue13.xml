  <TITLE>Change the default response code</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>For requests processed by Zuul, the default response code is 200. Returning a 200 has the potential to mask issues with routing filter changes. Making the default response status a 500 will allow for finding issues earlier. When a request is proxied to a backend, the status code for the proxy action is set by Zuul based on the response from the backend. However if the filter is not a static response filter and the response never enters the route/proxy filter process an empty response is sent out by zuul with a 200. Changes need to be made to prevent it from happening.</DESCRIPTION>
