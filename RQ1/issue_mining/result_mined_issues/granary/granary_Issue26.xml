  <TITLE>facebook: apply for read_stream permission</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>as part of the v2.x api upgrade (see snarfed/bridgy#339), facebook is drastically tightening the `read_stream` permission, which we need to see your friends' posts. it's an [extended permission](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/v2.2#reference-extended), which means you have to go through their [review process](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review) to get it. worse, even then they're unlikely to grant it. from https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/v2.2#reference-read_stream : &gt; This permission is granted to apps building a Facebook-branded client on platforms where Facebook is not already available. For example, Android and iOS apps will not be approved for this permission. In addition, Web, Desktop, in-car and TV apps will not be granted this permission. my one hope is to claim that this is a demo for a developer tool/library, so normal users won't use it. i'm not holding my breath though. :/ the faint silver lining is that app owners automatically get `read_stream` for their own facebook accounts, so we can at least keep testing it, even if the demo doesn't let other people any more. (snarfed/facebook-atom#2 is the same issue)</DESCRIPTION>
