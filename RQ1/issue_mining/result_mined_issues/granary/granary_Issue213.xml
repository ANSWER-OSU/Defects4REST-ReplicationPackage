  <TITLE>[reddit] Provide more info about the post</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I.e. if the post links to an image/video, it'd be good to have the `photo` / `video` properties respectively (in MF2) Or at least a `bookmark-of` the linked URL, if one is available</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>Return a post's `content` if present As noted in #212, it'd be useful to return the actual post's content, if it contains `selftext`. As part of this, we can rename `ACTIVITY_WITH_SELFTEXT` to make it clearer that the expected response includes `selftext`.</MESSAGE>
