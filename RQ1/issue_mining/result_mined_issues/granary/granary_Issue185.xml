  <TITLE>Support fragments</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I would like to use Granary to convert multiple h-feeds into different RSS feeds. I would like to add an id to the HTML element with the h-feed and then get an RSS using the link fragment.</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>Fix: Use the `url` of the post for the Meetup `rsvp-by-` As noticed by snarfed in bridg#906, there may not be an `actor`, as the source post may not contain the correct Microformats2 to describe it. We can instead use the `url` of the post to de-duplicate it, as it should be unique, and always present. But if it is not, it'll return an error to ensure the author fixes their post.</MESSAGE>
