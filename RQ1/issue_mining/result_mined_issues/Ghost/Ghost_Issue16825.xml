      <MESSAGE>Fixed search input focus on iOS refs https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/16825 - iOS is very restrictive on input focus which doesn't allow without any user interaction - The only workaround was creating a temporary input, focus it, and remove it after moving the focus to the actual searfch input - It also moves the inputRef to the parent component, so that it can be used in the click event handler, because the focus event only works when it's inside a function that's triggered after user interaction</MESSAGE>
