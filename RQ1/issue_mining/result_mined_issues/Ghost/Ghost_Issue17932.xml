      <MESSAGE>Fixed missing Admin assets in published tarball refs https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/17932 - we were missing `chunk.208.dbf172ad32f72f21a5dc.js` from our published tarball - turns out this is due to the lines in the `.npmignore` file to remove .db files, which also matched this file - we can make the regex more specific to avoid these cases</MESSAGE>
