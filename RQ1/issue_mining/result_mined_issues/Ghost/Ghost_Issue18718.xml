  <TITLE>Cannot have multiple custom images in new settings editor</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary When adding custom settings to a Ghost theme, it is not possible to have multiple images. One image can be uploaded (in either slot), but the second one cannot. It appears that the `&lt;input&gt;` tags for both image upload buttons have the same '`cover-image`' `id` assigned. Representative bit of the theme's package.json: ``` &quot;custom&quot;: { &quot;bonus_image&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;image&quot; }, &quot;bonus_image2&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;image&quot; } } ``` The second button is non-functional. Unless the first image is removed, in which case it works, and then the first button doesn't work once an image is uploaded in the second slot. ![image](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/assets/42299862/a964c2a8-de1b-4f6f-914f-cfd51c020e52) Behavior first described by another Ghost user here: https://forum.ghost.org/t/unable-to-add-more-images-via-custom-settings/42105/2 Personally confirmed by yours truly. ### Steps to Reproduce Install Ghost 5.70.1. Add the custom settings above to any theme (I used Source). Attempt to upload images to both image fields. ### Ghost Version 5.70.1 ### Node.js Version 18.16.0 ### How did you install Ghost? WSL. ### Database type SQLite3 ### Browser &amp; OS version Chrome, windows 10, recent version ### Relevant log / error output ```shell No errors logged to console. ``` ### Code of Conduct - [X] I agree to be friendly and polite to people in this repository</DESCRIPTION>
