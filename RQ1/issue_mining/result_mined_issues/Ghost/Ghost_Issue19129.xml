  <TITLE>Inline Code Formatting in Callout Card</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary # Issue Synopsis In previous versions of Ghost -- prior to upgrading to `5.74.3` -- inline code was formatted as expected in callout cards. Upon upgrading to the latest version, the inline code formatting still displays as expected in the editor view. However, when reading the published article, the formatting of the inline code is lost, and the inline code appears as plain text. This makes it difficult to emphasize and distinguish code and/or commands in callout cards. Inline code formatting in callout cards was last known to be working for me in Ghost `5.59`. # Screenshots **Callout Card with Code in Ghost `5.74.3` Editor** ![image](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/assets/26947869/837e67c9-0bfd-41e8-9606-dfa7734c04c3) **Callout Card in Ghost `5.74.3` Published Article** ![image](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/assets/26947869/e7a83f03-4b92-43b8-977c-88c44c8632e5) **Callout Card in Google Cache (Ghost `5.59`)** ![image](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/assets/26947869/8cd49210-4179-490b-82ca-a7b148cdae75) ### Steps to Reproduce 1. Create a new post or update an existing one 2. Add a new callout card or update an existing one 3. Add some text to the callout card, as well as one or many inline code blocks. Inline code blocks are created by wrapping text between backticks. \`inline code example\` == `inline code example` 4. Note that the inline code appears to be formatted correctly within the callout card 5. Publish or update the post, then open the published post 6. Note that the inline code formatting in the callout card does not match what's shown in the editor ### Ghost Version 5.74.3 ### Node.js Version 18.17.1 ### How did you install Ghost?
