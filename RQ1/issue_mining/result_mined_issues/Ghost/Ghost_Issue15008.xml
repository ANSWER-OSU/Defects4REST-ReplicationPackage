  <TITLE>Update UI/UX for deleting staff users</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary In 5.0 we changed the behaviour of what happens when staff users are deleted in admin. Before: We downloaded a full site backup, then deleted the user and all their posts Now: We transfer the posts of the deleted staff user to the owner user However, there are still some left-over rough edges. ## 1. Messaging and copy is out of date &lt;img width=&quot;661&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2022-07-07 at 17 15 59@2x&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120485/177810061-7c274b90-6fd6-4797-92d1-e4733b44ea37.png&quot;&gt; The copy has not been updated to reflect what will happen. We need to tell people that the posts will be transferred to the owner user (and who that is) ## 2. We no longer need to download a site backup We should stop triggering a site export when a user is deleted. It was tenuously relevant before (because it was a nightmare to import again if you needed to), it's not at all relevant now. ## 3. We should tag all transferred posts, so they're easy to find/filter If you do accidentally delete a staff user, we should make it easy to find all old posts written by the deleted user - by adding a private/internal tag to all of the affected posts, based on the `slug` of the staff user who was deleted: &lt;img width=&quot;621&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2022-07-07 at 17 22 22@2x&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120485/177810992-a2fadaf2-a938-4f94-bdf5-df3cbf960f1b.png&quot;&gt; Todos to track progress: - [x] stop backup download https://github.com/TryGhost/Admin/pull/2423 - [ ] assign internal tag to transferred posts https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/15019 - [x] copy update https://github.com/TryGhost/Admin/pull/2424</DESCRIPTION>

Without it the removal process is much smoother. - The backup still happens on the server side if it's absolutely needed at some point in the future</MESSAGE>
