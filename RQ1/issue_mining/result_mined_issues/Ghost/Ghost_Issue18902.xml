  <TITLE>Toggle card icon doesn't appear on iOS browsers</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary The icon indicating that Toggles can be opened and closed don't appear on iOS browsers (and this isn't just a Firefox issue, but a Safari issue as well). I have no idea whether or not this affects Android mobiles as well, but I do know that the icon does appear on macOS Safari, including when the viewport is shrunken down as narrow as it'll go. ![Xnapper-2023-11-08-10 24 27](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/assets/27488257/fd7e15f2-c525-4099-b110-84ceca980311) ### Steps to Reproduce 1. Visit the [Changlelog's Toggle page](https://ghost.org/changelog/toggles/) on an iOS browser 2.
