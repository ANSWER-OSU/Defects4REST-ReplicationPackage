  <TITLE>Update Twitter Icon in the Repository</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary Subject: Update Twitter Icon in the Repository Issue Description: ---------------------- **Problem:** The current Twitter icon used in the repository is outdated, and it does not align with the latest design changes made by Twitter. Twitter recently updated their icon to the new &quot;x&quot; design, and it's important to ensure that our repository stays up-to-date to maintain a consistent and modern appearance. ![Screenshot 2023-10-03 115534](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/assets/82380855/15293579-a74c-418e-b374-052243485d07) **Suggestion:** I propose that we update the Twitter icon in our repository to reflect the latest &quot;x&quot; design used by Twitter. This change will not only improve the visual appeal of our project but also show that we keep up with the latest trends and maintain our content relevancy. **Action Required:** I would like to work on this issue and contribute to the repository by updating the Twitter icon. I believe that this will be a valuable addition to the project, and I am committed to seeing it through. **Expected Results:** The Twitter icon in our repository should match the latest design used by Twitter. Let's keep our repository looking fresh and in line with current design standards. I'm excited to contribute to this improvement, and I welcome any guidance or feedback from the maintainers. Thank you for considering this enhancement. ### Steps to Reproduce Navigate to https://ghost.org/ Observe the current Twitter icon.
