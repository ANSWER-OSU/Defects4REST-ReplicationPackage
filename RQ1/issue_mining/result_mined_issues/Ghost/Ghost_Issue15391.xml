      <MESSAGE>Fixed Admin freeze when filtering long tag lists closes https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/15391 - `vertical-collection` component was throwing errors during render when the tags list was filtered down causing slowdowns or full Admin crashes - similar regression had popped up before and fixed in https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/15207 but the dependency had been bumped again without realising it caused an error - added a test that triggers the error-throwing behaviour in the tags input to help catch this in future dependency updates</MESSAGE>
