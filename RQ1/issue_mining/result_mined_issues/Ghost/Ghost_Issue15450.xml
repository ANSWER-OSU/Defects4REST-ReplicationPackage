  <TITLE>Keyboard shortcut to save does not save data in admin members form</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary When using the cmd+s keyboard shortcut while editing a Member _when the input field is focused_ the change not actually saved - When the page is reloaded, the data is not present. *This only seems to happen if the input field is focused*. If no field is focused (no green outline) then the save works as expected. ### Steps to Reproduce 1. default install of ghost 5.15 2. create a member 3. select (focus) the &quot;Note&quot; input and add some content 4. keeping the note field focused (green outline) use the cmd+s &quot;save&quot; shortcut. The &quot;saved&quot; green button indicator is shown (top right of right admin panel) 5. reload the page - observe the data added to note field is not saved note: the shortcut works if the field is not focused. ### Ghost Version 5.15 ### Node.js Version 16 ### How did you install Ghost? self hosted (EC2) on Ubuntu 22.04. followed self-host guide from ghost documentation ### Database type MySQL 8 ### Browser &amp; OS version Chrome (105.0.5195.125) &amp; Mac OS (12.4) ### Relevant log / error output _No response_ ### Code of Conduct - [X] I agree to be friendly and polite to people in this repository</DESCRIPTION>
