  <TITLE>Hebrew Support - Search</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary Hi I noticed that Hebrew characters are not supported in sodo-search. The issue is due to this line: [search-index.js#L146](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/main/apps/sodo-search/src/search-index.js#L146). It filters out the Hebrew Unicode block. I think the fix is simple: add \u0590-\u05FF to the regex ### Steps to Reproduce 1. Create a blog with Hebrew content, including tags, titles, etc. 2. Even after setting the publication language to &quot;he&quot;, the search does not find any matches. ### Ghost Version 5.111.0 ### Node.js Version 18 ### How did you install Ghost? cli ### Database type MySQL 5.7 ### Browser &amp; OS version _No response_ ### Relevant log / error output ```shell ``` ### Code of Conduct - [x] I agree to be friendly and polite to people in this repository</DESCRIPTION>
