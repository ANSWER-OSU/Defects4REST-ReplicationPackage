      <MESSAGE>Clarified &quot;Complimentary Plan&quot; in the importer refs https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/15814 - There's often a confusion around the logic of what makes &quot;Complimentary Plan&quot;. It's especially confusing during the import process, where a bulk of members gets assigned to complimentary plan. This is a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; fix for the problem, something more holistic will be worked out in the future</MESSAGE>
