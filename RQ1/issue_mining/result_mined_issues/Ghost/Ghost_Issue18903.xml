  <TITLE>Deletion of the final character of a link within a Toggle card can delete the entire link</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary Deleting the final character of a link in a Toggle card can delete the entire link. Sometimes, but not always. Because as seen in the video below, when I successfully deleted (and then un-did) the deletion of characters within a link I was able to move the cursor to the final character and successfully delete it (and nothing else). But when I moved the cursor away from the link and then returned to the position enabling me to delete the final character of the link, doing so once again deletes the entire link. https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/assets/27488257/1669cf81-b385-488d-8b8b-92372e8c1637 @9larsons This is a repeat of [this issue that you fixed](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/18674) within the general space of the editor. Not sure if it occurs anywhere else besides this. ### Steps to Reproduce 1. Place the cursor a few characters after the final character after a link within a toggle card, then move it to just after the final character of a link 2. Press the delete button 3. See the entire link disappear ### Ghost Version 5.71.2+moya ### Node.js Version Yes ### How did you install Ghost?
