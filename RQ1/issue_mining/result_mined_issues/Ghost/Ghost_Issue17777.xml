  <TITLE>&quot;@page.show_title_and_feature_image is not used&quot; is displayed as an error</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary Hello!, hope you are doing well. On a large amount of themes we are receiving this kind of error (probably 70 - 80% of themes in the Ghost marketplace, will get this as well): ![image](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/assets/5891905/58aacda6-4b77-41ca-933a-bd25aecc864a) Multiple customers are assuming the theme/platform do not work as expected, so we need to explain to every customer that is a beta feature and they can safely ignore it for the moment. After checking the info about this error: https://ghost.org/docs/themes/helpers/page/ this setting is only available when **&quot;beta editor setting&quot; is &quot;ON&quot;** from the Labs section, so this error shouldn't appear or at least should be displayed as a an &quot;information tooltip&quot; but not as an error. I think a quick solution would be to remove it as a &quot;critical error&quot;, but a good alternative would be to insert a new option into **&quot;package.json&quot;** to mark the theme as compatible or not **(similar to config -&gt; &quot;card_assets&quot;: true)**, and finally evaluate if the syntax is correct on the page.hbs file. Other Ghost Authors as @fueko are getting similar issues on https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/17745 that could be related. Thank you very much! ### Steps to Reproduce Upload any theme that do not include: `{{#match @page.show_title_and_feature_image}} ...content... {{/match}}` ### Ghost Version 5.59.1 ### Node.js Version v18.16.1 ### How did you install Ghost? localhost ### Database type SQLite3 ### Browser &amp; OS version _No response_ ### Relevant log / error output _No response_ ### Code of Conduct - [X] I agree to be friendly and polite to people in this repository</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>Fixed analytics exports to fetch on demand in Admin X (#17802) refs https://ghost.slack.com/archives/C0568LN2CGJ/p1692804385770949 - Analytics exports was previously retrieved on on page load instead of on demand. - This fixes that to ensure it gets fetched when the user hits the download button. - Renamed the file saving to `post-analytics.yyyy-mm-dd.csv` --- &lt;!-- Leave the line below if you'd like GitHub Copilot to generate a summary from your commit --&gt; &lt;!-- copilot:summary --&gt; ### &lt;samp&gt; Generated by Copilot at 2c96e78&lt;/samp&gt; Improved the export posts feature in the membership settings by fetching the data only on demand and adding a date to the file name. Modified the `usePostsExports` hook and the `exportPosts` function in `Analytics.tsx`.</MESSAGE>
