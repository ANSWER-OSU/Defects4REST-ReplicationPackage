  <TITLE>Feature image caption displays only one line</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary As the title says, the feature image caption in the editor displays only one line. Recently I saw it displaying something like a max of three lines (with the rest overlapping the title below it), but I hadn't gotten around to reporting the bug. Now it's worse though, as only one line gets displayed without even displaying the rest in an incorrect manner. In the image below you can see the spell-check red markers, as well as a few descenders, from the line above. ![Xnapper-2024-01-23-14 43 15](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/assets/27488257/e669975e-7c86-4db2-9f56-7c0425052a8c) ### Steps to Reproduce 1. Create a feature image caption that is long enough that it extends to more than a single line 2. See that only a single line gets displayed ### Ghost Version 5.76.1+moya ### Node.js Version Yes ### How did you install Ghost?
