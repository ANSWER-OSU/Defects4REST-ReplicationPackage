  <TITLE>Random response delays</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi guys, I've been noticing slow responses in services that We have hosted in now. In order to demonstrate this I just create a small API (https://demo-api-yhqgghkgjg.now.sh/) using NodeJs, and a dummy endpoint that just sends a json object like this: ``` { &quot;hello&quot;: true } ``` Nothing to complicated, and If you start hitting this endpoint you'll see very fast response times ( 200ms average ) BUT sometimes you'll see some random delays. Attach you'll find a couple of screens using Postman. Sometimes I have to wait 3 to 4 seconds in order to get the response back. I tried this same test using an AWS EC2 instance and all response are really fast ( no delays at all ). Is this because `now` is a SHARE cloud service where all resources ( CPU, memory, etc ) are share between other users ?. 3129ms delay: ![screen shot 2017-05-28 at 2 58 21 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1002407/26532285/be0f8a1c-43b9-11e7-986b-0c1c5465bfef.png) 4228ms delay: ![screen shot 2017-05-28 at 3 03 35 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1002407/26532286/be320150-43b9-11e7-9b30-ff202b981983.png) Notes: This also happens with paid accounts.</DESCRIPTION>
