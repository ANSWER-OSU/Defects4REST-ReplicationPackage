  <TITLE>Why not host on NPM instead of downloading in a postinstall script?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The reason I ask is because it seems dubious to have someone run `npm i -g now` to install essentially nothing, and then postinstall downloads the actual tool. It seems like abuse of the NPM registry, using it in a way that wasn't intended. I'm not saying that Now is dubious, just that the install process might seem dubious to some. --- But anyways, all the Zeit stuff is simply awesome, and it's a great product!!</DESCRIPTION>
