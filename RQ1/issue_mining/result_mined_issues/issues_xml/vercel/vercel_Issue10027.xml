      <MESSAGE>[remix] Install `@vercel/remix-run-dev` at build-time instead of using symlink (#9784) Instead of including the fork `@remix-run/dev` package as a regular dependency of `@vercel/remix-builder`, install it at build-time by modifying the project's `package.json` file. The reasons for this are: * Avoids deprecation warnings from a few packages that currently exist on the `@remix-run/dev` package when installing Vercel CLI (those warnings already show up in the build logs anyways, so nothing new there). * Allows us to install a version as close as possible to the version specified in the user's `package.json` (similar to how we do when auto-injecting the `@vercel/remix` package). This will be especially important once Remix v2 is released, which will have breaking changes compared to v1. **Note:** `@vercel/remix-run-dev` is still a _dev_ dependency, so that we can use TypeScript types from it, as well as, at runtime, we use the version in the Builder's `package.json` to determine the maximum versions of `@vercel/remix-run-dev` and/or `@vercel/remix` which can safely be installed. Fixes #10027. Fixes #10222.</MESSAGE>
