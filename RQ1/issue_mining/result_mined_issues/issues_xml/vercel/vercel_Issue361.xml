  <TITLE>Support for `now alias &lt;domain.tld&gt;`</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>In cases where you can't have a configuration (like when running `now user/repo`), we still need a way for aliasing the latest deployment easily. In turn, this need to work: ```bash now &amp;&amp; now alias domain.tld ``` And it should deploy + assign the alias &quot;domain.tld&quot; to that deployment.</DESCRIPTION>

  <BUGGYCOMMIT>
    <MESSAGE>don't include the &quot;main&quot; file by default (#464) It's not correct to forcefully include the file specified in &quot;main&quot; at upload-time. Consider an `npm run build` script that ends up creating the file that &quot;main&quot; specifies. It would not exist until inside the deployment, after the build script is ran for that deployment. Fixes https://github.com/zeit/now-cli/issues/281.</MESSAGE>
