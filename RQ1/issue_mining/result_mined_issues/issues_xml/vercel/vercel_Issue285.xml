  <TITLE>CDN, compression, caching, throttling, SSL, etc</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I asked the question on Next.js' side but didn't get any luck (https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/985) so am asking here again I'm building a Next.js + Now (+ GraphQL etc) prototype app and recently upgraded to a paid Now account: https://github.com/relatenow/relate The initial &quot;advertising&quot; I got of using Now is that you &quot;just&quot; run `now` and that's it But of course I understand if there is still more to it than just running this one-liner to get ready for production, and steps probably need to be taken to set up these things &quot;in front&quot; of the webapp: 1. SSL 2. fast DNS resolution 3. HTTP/2 4. load-balancing 5. compression 6. CDN (don't know where are Zeit data centers, compared e.g to Cloudflare's 102 data centers) 7. caching, cache storage optimization, localStorage caching 8. accelerated mobile page links (AMP) 9. mobile image optimization 10. throttling, DDOS protection 11. WAF My understanding is that Now currently provides 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in some form of another. It would be awesome to know: 1. where is Now currently at, what does it want to provide or not provide in the future, what's the roadmap? 2. what configuration does the user need to provide for each of these features to work, if any? 3. how performant are each of these functionalities compared to competition? (e.g DNS resolution speed, perf across different world regions) 4. what does Now recommend to use in conjunction with it, for the things it does not support? 5. Where can people go to learn to take care of the rest? Is there some better &quot;checklist&quot; than listed above? 6. Are there any examples or documentation to answer these questions or if not, could some documentation be created? Thanks! EDIT: restructured and enumerated the questions.</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>[now-go] Add missing await to `getExportedFunctionName()` (#285) This fixes a subtle bug in the `getExportedFunctionName()` helper function. It wasn't actually causing any issues in production, since the `index.js` file also does `await` on the return value of this function so it was still resolving the promise properly, but this is more correct and fixes the associated `debug()` call.</MESSAGE>
