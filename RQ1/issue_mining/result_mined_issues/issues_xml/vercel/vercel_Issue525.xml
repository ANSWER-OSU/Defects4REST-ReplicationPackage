  <TITLE>What are those things I keep hearing about FROZEN states?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>What's the default policy to FREEZE a deployment? It doesn't make any sense to me to be paying for a service that shutdown my apps randomly, especially in my case, because I use `Meteor`, which apps are known to take some time to boot up. I linked a `ping` service to my `now` apps and I'm constantly receiving emails about my apps going down and up. How I'm suppose to be taken seriously by my users if my apps are almost always failing? Do `now` service isn't suitable for Meteor apps? I have the understanding that a Meteor app is just a NodeJS app, so what's the matter with this? The only reason I see this service useful is for apps like Facebook, which are constantly been visited. In my case, I have apps which are used 3 times per week, Monday, Thursday and Saturday, for example. am I wrong?</DESCRIPTION>
