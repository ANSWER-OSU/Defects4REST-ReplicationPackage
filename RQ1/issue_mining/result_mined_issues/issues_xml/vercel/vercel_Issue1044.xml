  <TITLE>Now rm --safe throws an error if it couldn't find deployments</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I use CI for my project and after it runs `now rm --yes --safe project-name` and could not find deployments it throws an error and my build fails. I suggest to change `error` to `warning` or just common `log`.</DESCRIPTION>
