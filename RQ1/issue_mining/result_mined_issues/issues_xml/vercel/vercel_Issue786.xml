  <TITLE>AccessDenied when trying to deploy to AWS Lambda</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>_From @callumlocke on August 3, 2017 14:3_ I get this error when I do `now aws` (user details censored): ``` AccessDenied: User: arn:aws:iam::***********:user/********** is not authorized to perform: iam:GetRole on resource: role now-default-role ``` I'm not able to give total &quot;AdministratorAccess&quot; on my company's AWS account. I have to request a minimal set of permissions and wait to get it approved. From the above it looks like I need a policy that allows the `iam:GetRole` action. Can you tell me what other actions I need to allow? A minimal sample policy would be useful. _Copied from original issue: zeit/now#40_</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>[now-node] Yarn workspaces/transpilation followup (#782) * tests transpilation of yarn workspaces up until @now/node@0.7.4-canary.28 this used to work out of the box * tests that typescript workspaces are properly compiled * update node-file-trace, symlink handling * update node-file-trace, use index.ts in package.json main * remove logging! * adds test with ts files in a subdir * Updates typescript example to avoid node internal special casing The initial example ended up passing even with a flawed implementation because it unknowingly relied on a special case within node module's resulotion engine which automaticaly resolves index files within a module if they are located in the same directory as the module's `package.json` * upgrade to node-file-trace 0.2.2 * cleanup manual debugging leftovers * fix yarn lock for node-file-trace 0.2.2 * more cleanup of manual tests I offer my apologies about this mess</MESSAGE>
