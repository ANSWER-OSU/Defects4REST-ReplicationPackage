  <TITLE>List Deployments w/ Aliases</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I know we can see them both separately (now ls + now alias ls), but seeing this info together would help. now ls -a (alias/advanced/all?) Great if we could see both running instances along with their aliases. Perhaps a column with an orange colored alias name. It's difficult to know which deployment is which.</DESCRIPTION>
