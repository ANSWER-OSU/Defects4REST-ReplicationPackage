  <TITLE>Node 7.7.10 being ignored</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The release of NPM 5 / Node 8 doesn't work with my app. I'll debug it, but in the short term I need to deploy. I have `engines.node` in my now.json set to 7.7.10, but on every deploy Now tells me: &gt; Warning! Requested node version 7.7.10 is not available 8.0.0 How do I switch back to NPM 4 / Node 7?</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>[now-next] Fix erroneous `.next` folder message (#606) We now store the `.next/cache` folder so we need to check for the `static` folder to know if the user uploaded something they should've excluded.</MESSAGE>

      <MESSAGE>[now-next] Humanize message about `now-build` (#607) Some users read this message as a warning that required action (the captain caps lock WARNING didn't help). Users should never need to define a `now-build` script unless they grow out of running `next build`.</MESSAGE>
