  <TITLE>Idea! Include rules.json in a deployment instead of having to explicitly upload</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>After chatting with @timneutkens today, I found I had misunderstood how `rules.json` worked — I thought I could deploy just the `rules.json` to a domain or subdomain, and use that to assemble all the services. Based on this from [the docs](https://zeit.co/docs/features/path-aliases#alias-rules), `now alias company.com -r rules.json`, I thought I could just do that on an empty domain I'd just bought; I didn't realize that you have to have a **root deployment** _plus_ rules. Rules are like _extra_ routes. So that's one thing, but then once I understood that you needed a root deployment, I thought a nice feature might be just including the `rules.json` in it, rather than having to explicitly called `-r rules.json` each time you want to update it. It would be less work to update, and also could keep the rules in version control with the root deployment you have to have anyway!</DESCRIPTION>
