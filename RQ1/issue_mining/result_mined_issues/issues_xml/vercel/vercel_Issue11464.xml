  <TITLE>getInstalledPackageVersion is not a function</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello, I tried to build using `vercel build` 20 minutes ago using `vercel@latest` installed with `npm install -g vercel@latest` but I get this error : `Error: (0 , import_build_utils13.getInstalledPackageVersion) is not a function`. My GitHub Actions builds keep failing because they encounter this error at the end. How can I fix it?</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>[static-build] Don't rely on `hugo` binary existing in build-container (#11455) * Makes `hugo` framework preset work when Node.js v20.x is selected in Project Settings. * Stores the downloaded `hugo` binary in the `.vercel/cache` directory, so that it does not need to be re-downloaded upon every deployment. * Makes `vc build` work when run locally for Hugo projects - tested on macOS arm64.</MESSAGE>
