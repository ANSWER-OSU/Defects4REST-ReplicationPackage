  <TITLE>Important failure in alias</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We have automated deployments, today we had a billing problem, and our account was downgraded. The deployment don't allow files higher than 1MB but it doesn't fail. Although we were able to reassign the alias to the new _malformed_ new deployment and for obvious reasons it doesn't work anymore in the new aliased release. Proposal: If the account doesn't support aliases, or the alias have a paid deployment and we are assigning an OSS one; throw an error when trying to reassign the alias.</DESCRIPTION>
