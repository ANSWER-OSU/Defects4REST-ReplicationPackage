  <TITLE>Failed webpack build step of a universal redux react app</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I am not sure if this is the place to report issues with now, but here I go anyway. I keep getting an error in my now deployments. First of all a little context. I am deploying a server rendered rect app with redux bootstraped using [universal kyt](https://github.com/NYTimes/kyt-starter-universal), and I have a build step that compiles the app using webpack. The problem is that the build step fails on now, but works perfectly on my machine. The error I am getting is `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'lodash/isPlainObject' in '/home/nowuser/src/node_modules/e3d8a6548416ea90c89022179a97a8ef8f8428d0/lib/components'` I think that this error comes from the `react-redux` package (I cannot tell for sure because now shows a hash instead of the package name) I reproduced the error locally using the same node version and starting from an empty node_modules folder. With this configuration everything works perfectly on my machine, but fails on now. I hacked a solution by forking react-redux, and changing lodash dependency to lodash.isplainobject because that is the only function that react-redux needs. Using my fork of react-redux everything works fine, so the problem has something to do with now and react-redux lodash dependency. Anyone came across this kind of error before? Any idea of how to solve this without my ugly fork?</DESCRIPTION>
