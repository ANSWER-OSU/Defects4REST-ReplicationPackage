  <TITLE>now deploy hangs forever on travis-ci</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi there, Pro subscriber here! I'm having some trouble getting a `now` deploy script to exit on Travis-CI. Running the script locally works just fine, but on travis, it consistently will not finish. [On this line](https://github.com/zeit/now-cli/blob/cb8403174b2807ff5884ac6b64630c6e7d44f393/bin/now-deploy.js#L150) it states that you've had some issues with stdout not flushing and it looks like that function [isn't being used here](https://github.com/zeit/now-cli/blob/cb8403174b2807ff5884ac6b64630c6e7d44f393/bin/now-deploy.js#L613), where I think the issue might be originating. Here's one of the failed builds for reference: https://travis-ci.org/aliemteam/aliemcards/builds/195055148#L347 Here's the deploy script that I'd like to use: https://github.com/aliemteam/aliemcards/blob/master/deploy (Side Note: I'm aware of your node library, but the cli tool is way easier to use for my purposes) Thanks so much for the help and all you've done for the OSS community! Let me know if there's anything I might be able to assist with.</DESCRIPTION>
