  <TITLE>[Config] Ignore files</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Is there any plans for Now to be able to ignore files uploaded? I know it allows to force upload `.gitignore` files, but the opposite would be rad. Use case would be if a project has a React Storybook associated with it, but you don't want the storybook and all the assets associated with it on your `now` instance.</DESCRIPTION>
