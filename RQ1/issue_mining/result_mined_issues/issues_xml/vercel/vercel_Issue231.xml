  <TITLE>Revert to package.json `name` as deployment name default</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I've been deploying my OSS projects out of their respective `dist` directories. Before upgrading to the latest version, my deployment's default name would be parsed from the `dist/package.json`. It's now using the current/targeted directory name as its default. This quickly becomes a problem when multiple projects (all with `dist`) are deployed and share the same base &amp; identifier. ```sh # now dist ... https://dist-ngetttuaxt.now.sh 8m ago ... https://dist-wgbalakrxl.now.sh 12m ago ... https://dist-kwnbojmpnv.now.sh 13d ago # preferred colors-app ... https://icolors-ngetttuaxt.now.sh 8m ago inferno-starter ... https://inferno-starter-kwnbojmpnv.now.sh 13d ago preact-starter ... https://preact-starter-wgbalakrxl.now.sh 10d ago ``` Without being careful, you'll quickly have a stack of `dist` deployments, and won't know which are safe to get rid of without visiting each url individually. Lastly, I realize that there **is** a `--name` flag that I can use, but this is only on initial deployment. I cannot fix/rename a deployment after it's been made. I can only &quot;fix&quot; it by redeploying &amp; including a `--name` flag, which makes your system work more than it should need to.</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>[now-node] Migrate to TypeScript and use `@now/node-bridge` v1 (#212) This moves `@now/node` to being implemented in TypeScript. It also updates it to use the latest `@now/node-bridge`, which removes the hard-coded port 3000 that was previously in-place, which was problematic for `now dev`. Now the `http.Server` instance listens on an ephemeral port which is detected by the Now node runtime.</MESSAGE>
