  <TITLE>Unlimited hosting? How do you support this?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The docs say &gt; ## Unlimited &gt; &gt; Every time you run `now`, you get a fresh URL that represents the current state of your application. &gt; &gt; - No need to remove old ones &gt; - No setup of applications or projects &gt; - URLs stay around forever --- How can this be sustained? For example, what if I'm new to programming, a friend shows me how to write a Node program, then every time I want to test it I just run `now`? Suppose I run `now` every minute to generate a new URL? After a few days, I may have published hundreds of deployments just to test an app, because it was easy. How is this sustained? Is it because a &quot;sleep&quot; mode deactivates the actual app after a time of no activity, so that runtime resources are not consumed? But there's still disk space required to store every deployment's source. After a while, developing locally and publishing hundreds of test deployments, I may have used a TON of your disk space. You guys are totally okay with this as long as my stuff is OSS, just using infinite disk space?</DESCRIPTION>
