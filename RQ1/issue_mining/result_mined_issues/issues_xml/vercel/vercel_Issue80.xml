      <MESSAGE>Help users to deal with secrets starting with dash People are often trying to store secrets starting with dashes such as private keys. These dashes get interpreted as command line options which effectively prevents a storage of private keys. Fortunately, this is easily resolved by using bash -- convention to mark an end of options, such as: `now secret add google-secret-key -- &quot;-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVXYZ+/a -----END PRIVATE KEY-----&quot; The problem is also discussed in following issues: https://github.com/zeit/now-cli/issues/749 https://github.com/zeit/now-cli/issues/80</MESSAGE>
