  <TITLE>Now upload failed error, but little details</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I'm using now to deploy a static web site. During the deployment, something went wrong: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/393660/26458848/1e476b8e-413a-11e7-909b-c08702a7b01e.png) I've got little to no idea what &quot;Response error&quot; means here. Well, I can guess it means the CLI didn't like what it heard back from the server, but I don't know how to go forward in terms of correcting it.</DESCRIPTION>
