  <TITLE>'now alias' command fails if package.json missing but now.json exists with &quot;alias&quot;: ... entry</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I have a javascript/webpack app which on build, compiles a static website into the `dist` folder. The `dist` folder includes `now.json` file with an `alias` entry. To deploy I cd into the `dist` folder and run `now`, which deploys successfully, but running `now alias` fails with the following error: ``` &gt; Error! Failed to read JSON in &quot;.../dist/package.json&quot; ```</DESCRIPTION>
