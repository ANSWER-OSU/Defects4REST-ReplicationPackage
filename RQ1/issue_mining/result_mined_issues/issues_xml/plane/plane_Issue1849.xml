  <TITLE>[feature]: use a subpath in the public URL</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Summary I would like to use a subpath in a self-hosted environment in order to address the application. Something like http://example.com/subpath/. I read the existing documentation twice, but didn't find any hint. Has anyone successfully setup such an installation? Is this possible? Is such a feature planed? ### Why should this be worked on? I would expect that many corporate environments require such limitations.</DESCRIPTION>
