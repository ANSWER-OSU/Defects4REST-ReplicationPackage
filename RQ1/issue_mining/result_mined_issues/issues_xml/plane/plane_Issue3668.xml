  <TITLE>[bug]: Issues closed in a year chart reports incorrect information</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Current behavior On the analytics tab there is a **Issues closed in a year** chart. The chart plots Jan to Dec the number of issues closed. Currently this chart is showing incorrect info, it looks like issues have been closed in Dec 2024 but actually they were closed in Dec 2023. The x axis should be dynamic and always show in the right side the current month, and then 12 months before that going to the left. So now on the right should be Feb 2024, then a Jan 2024, then dec 2023 and so on. Either that or keep the x axis as is but only plot current year information. but this is a less desirable option. &lt;img width=&quot;1891&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-02-14 at 22 39 10&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/makeplane/plane/assets/4695692/74ee058b-49c9-40f0-90cb-277b760a1511&quot;&gt; ### Steps to reproduce Create and close a few issues Go to Analytics on the left menu See chart at the bottom of the page ### Browser Safari ### Version Self-hosted</DESCRIPTION>
