  <TITLE>How do I get error logs related to emails?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi! So, I'm having some issues where inviting a person doesn't seem to send an email at all. I'm self-hosting my mail service and it works with my other tools. I've experienced issues with it in the past so I'm wondering where I can find the error logs for emails so I can debug the issue. I have decided to open an issue instead of following #2867 because it seems like Discussions are not looked at by maintainers.</DESCRIPTION>
