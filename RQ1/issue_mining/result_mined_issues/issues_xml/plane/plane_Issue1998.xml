  <TITLE>[bug]: plane sends requests on every keystroke</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Current behavior Whenever someone tries to create an issue by attaching 2 (or more) images and then starts typing content, Plane starts sending (failing) requests with every keystroke. This only happens when 2 or more images are attached to the issue. Here's the image of the network tab, not sure if it'll be helpful: ![image](https://github.com/makeplane/plane/assets/11243138/8a1769dd-9400-490a-bc2b-b3e5dcee5ac9) ### Steps to reproduce 1. Create a new issue 2. Attach multiple images to the issue 3. Start typing in the textbox You'll notice in the network tab (and even console) that Plane sends a `DELETE` request every time a key is pressed. This shouldn't be happening, since a 1000-word issue will result in a 1000 requests being attempted. ### Browser Mozilla Firefox ### Version Self-hosted</DESCRIPTION>
