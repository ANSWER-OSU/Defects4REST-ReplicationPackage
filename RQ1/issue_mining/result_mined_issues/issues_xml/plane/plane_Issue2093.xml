  <TITLE>[bug]: Recent change to docker-compose-hub.yml is targeting non existent container label for plane-deploy</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Current behavior It appears that a recent change to the docker-compose-hub.yml included a new container stored at makeplane/plane-deploy. I double checked and it looks like the only label currently on docker hub for that container is develop. This breaks being able to deploy without changing the target label to 'develop'. ### Steps to reproduce 1. Checkout &quot;master&quot; (develop) 2. Follow self-hosting [guide](https://docs.plane.so/self-hosting) 3. When running `docker compose -f docker-compose-hub.yml up` the following error response is received from docker `Error response from daemon: manifest for makeplane/plane-deploy:latest not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown` ### Browser Google Chrome ### Version Self-hosted</DESCRIPTION>
