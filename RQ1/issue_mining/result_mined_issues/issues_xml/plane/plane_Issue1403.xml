  <TITLE>[bug]: A long Issue title or description pushes the components out of screen without even scroll</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Current behavior If I write a very long Issue Title or Issue Description, It pushes the sidebar out of view.

Go to Projects 2. Go to issues 3. Create a new issue with a very long title/description [Screencast](https://github.com/makeplane/plane/assets/122923000/c66bcd29-5640-4ac7-a88f-2893bc1b6703) ### Browser Google Chrome ### Version Cloud</DESCRIPTION>
