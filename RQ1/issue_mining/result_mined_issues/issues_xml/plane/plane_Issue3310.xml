  <TITLE>[bug]: Estimate numbers not respecting order</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Current behavior Hi! Firstly thank you for the great work on this web-app, I love it so far and I am excited to use it through its continued development. ### __Summary Of Issue__ Since release `v0.14-dev` the estimate order is no longer respected. In the example video below I set the numbers in the specific order that I want them to show up in and after I hit save it reorders them alphabetically. I believe this is a bug and I am hoping it can be fixed in the next release! https://github.com/makeplane/plane/assets/148405039/6dbc7a17-4636-4b13-aa32-2874ba6c4f67 ### __Expected outcome__ I would like the numbers to stay in the order I put them in like it did in the prior release. So if I create estimates like this: * 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:5, 5:8, 6:13 After I hit save I'm hoping they stay in that order ### Steps to reproduce 1. Go to the estimates page 2. Create or edit an estimate 3. Save Estimates 4. Edit estimates and watch them get reordered alphabetically ### Browser Google Chrome ### Version Cloud</DESCRIPTION>
