  <TITLE>[bug]: (minor) Favicon missing from self-hosted instances</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Current behavior Favicon doesn't appear on any self-hosted version I've tried so far. Looks like /favicon/[filename.ico] doesn't exist/can't be reached. Not sure if this causes any other issues aside from the visual. ### Steps to reproduce As described above ### Browser Google Chrome ### Version Self-hosted</DESCRIPTION>
