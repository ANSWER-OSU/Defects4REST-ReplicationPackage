  <TITLE>[bug]: Minio uses localhost</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Current behavior Hi, I tried running plane work behind traefik reverse proxy, and it almost works, except for the file upload which seems to use localhost for minio calls. I can't find where I can change these settings. Here is the setup I use: &lt;details&gt; &lt;summary&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/summary&gt; ```yaml version: &quot;3.8&quot; services: web: container_name: web build: context: . dockerfile: ./web/Dockerfile.web args: DOCKER_BUILDKIT: 1 restart: always command: /usr/local/bin/start.sh web/server.js web depends_on: - api - worker labels: - &quot;traefik.http.routers.${APP_PROJECT}.rule=Host(`${APP_DOMAIN}`)&quot; - &quot;traefik.http.services.${APP_PROJECT}-service.loadbalancer.server.port=3000&quot; space: container_name: space build: context: . dockerfile: ./space/Dockerfile.space args: DOCKER_BUILDKIT: 1 restart: always command: /usr/local/bin/start.sh space/server.js space depends_on: - api - worker - web api: container_name: api build: context: ./apiserver dockerfile: Dockerfile.api args: DOCKER_BUILDKIT: 1 restart: always command: ./bin/takeoff env_file: - ./apiserver/.env depends_on: - plane-db - plane-redis labels: - &quot;traefik.http.routers.${APP_PROJECT}-api.rule=Host(`${APP_DOMAIN}`) &amp;&amp; PathPrefix(`/api`)&quot; - &quot;traefik.http.services.${APP_PROJECT}-api-service.loadbalancer.server.port=8000&quot; worker: container_name: bgworker build: context: ./apiserver dockerfile: Dockerfile.api args: DOCKER_BUILDKIT: 1 restart: always command: ./bin/worker env_file: - ./apiserver/.env depends_on: - api - plane-db - plane-redis beat-worker: container_name: beatworker build: context: ./apiserver dockerfile: Dockerfile.api args: DOCKER_BUILDKIT: 1 restart: always command: ./bin/beat env_file: - ./apiserver/.env depends_on: - api - plane-db - plane-redis plane-db: container_name: plane-db image: postgres:15.2-alpine restart: always command: postgres -c 'max_connections=1000' volumes: - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data env_file: - .env environment: POSTGRES_USER: ${PGUSER} POSTGRES_DB: ${PGDATABASE} POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${PGPASSWORD} PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data plane-redis: container_name: plane-redis image: redis:6.2.7-alpine restart: always volumes: - redisdata:/data plane-minio: container_name: plane-minio image: minio/minio restart: always command: server /export --console-address &quot;:9090&quot; volumes: - uploads:/export environment: MINIO_ROOT_USER: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} labels: - &quot;traefik.http.routers.${APP_PROJECT}-minio.rule=Host(`${APP_DOMAIN}`) &amp;&amp; PathPrefix(`/${AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME}`)&quot; - &quot;traefik.http.services.${APP_PROJECT}-minio-service.loadbalancer.server.port=9000&quot; createbuckets: image: minio/mc entrypoint: &gt; /bin/sh -c &quot; /usr/bin/mc config host add plane-minio http://plane-minio:9000 \$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY; /usr/bin/mc mb plane-minio/\$AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME; /usr/bin/mc anonymous set download plane-minio/\$AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME; exit 0; &quot; env_file: - .env depends_on: - plane-minio volumes: pgdata: redisdata: uploads: networks: default: name: web external: true ``` &lt;/details&gt; &lt;details&gt; &lt;summary&gt;.env&lt;/summary&gt; ``` APP_PROJECT=&quot;plane&quot; APP_DOMAIN=&quot;my.plane.host.name&quot; # Database Settings PGUSER=&quot;plane&quot; PGPASSWORD=&quot;very-secret-plane-password&quot; PGHOST=&quot;plane-db&quot; PGDATABASE=&quot;plane&quot; DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${PGUSER}:${PGPASSWORD}@${PGHOST}/${PGDATABASE} # Redis Settings REDIS_HOST=&quot;plane-redis&quot; REDIS_PORT=&quot;6379&quot; REDIS_URL=&quot;redis://${REDIS_HOST}:6379/&quot; # AWS Settings AWS_REGION=&quot;&quot; AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=&quot;plane-access-key&quot; AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=&quot;my-very-secret-plane-key&quot; # AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=&quot;http://plane-minio:9000&quot; AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=&quot;http://${APP_DOMAIN}/&quot; # Changing this requires change in the nginx.conf for uploads if using minio setup AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=&quot;uploads&quot; # Maximum file upload limit FILE_SIZE_LIMIT=5242880 # GPT settings OPENAI_API_BASE=&quot;https://api.openai.com/v1&quot; # change if using a custom endpoint OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;sk-&quot; # add your openai key here GPT_ENGINE=&quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot; # use &quot;gpt-4&quot; if you have access # Settings related to Docker DOCKERIZED=1 # set to 1 If using the pre-configured minio setup USE_MINIO=1 ``` &lt;/details&gt; ### Steps to reproduce Using the files above, I start the container and try to upload a logo for the current workspace and every aws/minio call are requested to localhost &lt;img width=&quot;1339&quot; alt=&quot;SCR-20231003-ihpa&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/makeplane/plane/assets/6014/34cc6a43-e7ad-4171-be54-83812329a40f&quot;&gt; `http://localhost/uploads/01547f90-620e-44b6-9ee2-2cb1dae46380/7bfb56129cbd41fe82e7fc6a5b123735-gradient_spinner_w_BTZnewH.png` ### Browser Mozilla Firefox ### Version Self-hosted</DESCRIPTION>
