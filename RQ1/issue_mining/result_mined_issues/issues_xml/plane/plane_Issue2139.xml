  <TITLE>[bug]: Project identifier rules are misleading</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Current behavior Creating a project results in different rules for limiting the allowed characters for the &quot;identifier field&quot; depending on the page you edit the field. Which currently displays 3 different rules and messages: - Identifier error message on project creation says: &quot;Identifier must at most be of **`12 characters`**&quot; - Identifier description in form says: &quot;Create a **`1-6 characters`**' identifier for the project.&quot; - Actual rule and error message says: &quot;Identifier must at most be of **`5 characters`**&quot; Screenshots: [Create new project](https://github.com/makeplane/plane/assets/67892761/742f3611-7bac-4405-8d2c-f3a1dfd1ab42), [Edit project settings](https://github.com/makeplane/plane/assets/67892761/2c4e3f6f-ac23-471f-a035-cd8efc3db0a9) #### What I expect ist: All **rules** for setting an identifier name **should be identical**, currently we have 3 different behaviours So please normalize the rules to support 1 rule for all 3 occurences of the identifier field. I would love to see the 12 characters rule applied as it provides more options to set an identifier, but I'm also fine with a max of 6 characters. ### Steps to reproduce 1. Navigate to &quot;projects&quot; and click on `+ Add project` 2. Defining the &quot;identifier&quot;, e.g. `A23MYLA` (which is 7 characters long) 3. Press `Create project` and navigate to &quot;project settings&quot; 4. After changing some stuff on the main page simply hit `Update project` 5. Saving/Updating is not possible due to an form error: &quot;_Identifier must at most be of 5 characters_&quot; ### Browser Other (chromium based Edge) ### Version Cloud</DESCRIPTION>
