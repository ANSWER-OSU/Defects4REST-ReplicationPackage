  <TITLE>Changing admin email address</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, After I created the docker containers for plane I started creating cycles, issues, boards, ... and then I noticed I was still using the default captain@plane.so mail address for my user. It seems that changing it is not possible in the UI so I was wondering if there is a way to still change it? If not, I will probably just have to recreate my docker containers and volumes so I can start fresh? Thanks, reggi</DESCRIPTION>
