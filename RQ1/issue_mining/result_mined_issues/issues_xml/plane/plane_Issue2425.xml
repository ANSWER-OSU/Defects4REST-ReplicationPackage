  <TITLE>[feature]: Enable pasting markdown into editor</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Summary Hi there, I tried to copy and paste markdown-formatted content into the description field of the issue editor. It didn't work as expected i.e. the content is treated as plain text and therefore not rendered accordingly. I saw there is a corresponding option for the `tiptap-markdown` plugin to enable this feature: ~~~ diff --git a/web/components/tiptap/extensions/index.tsx b/web/components/tiptap/extensions/index.tsx index 8ad4e07..36e9b93 100644 --- a/web/components/tiptap/extensions/index.tsx +++ b/web/components/tiptap/extensions/index.tsx @@ -141,6 +141,7 @@ export const TiptapExtensions = ( Markdown.configure({ html: true, transformCopiedText: true, + transformPastedText: true }), Table, TableHeader, ~~~ Any chance this feature get's activated? ### Why should this be worked on? It would be much easier to migrate to Plane from another system that uses markdown for content.</DESCRIPTION>
