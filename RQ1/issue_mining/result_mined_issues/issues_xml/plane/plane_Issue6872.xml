  <TITLE>[feature]: Alert when creating a work item without properties</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [x] I have searched the existing issues ### Summary - user should be able to confirm creating a work item with 0 properties (Only the work item title) - Alert should follow the graphic chart of the platform ### Why should this be worked on? It's better to let the user know that he could make use of the properties that come with the work item or doing an extra step to confirm the work item with 0 properties.</DESCRIPTION>
