  <TITLE>docs: add Spanish translations</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION># Improve Docs ## Please describe which part of docs should be improved or typo fixed From a Google search `Spanish` is now the world's **4th most spoken language** in the world. &lt;img width=&quot;620&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2021-02-12 at 6 23 19 am&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/418747/107695225-05374a00-6cfc-11eb-81e0-ce577b8f55ae.png&quot;&gt; ## Describe the solution you'd like A translation process overtime where the Markdown documentation files are translated into Spanish. First doc to translate would be the `README` as `README_ES.md`. I am offering to work on this doing most of the GitHub, Git, training and management work if needed. I run a small team where I train people too and even have some friends that write in India and Asia. I don't speak Spanish but I have three colleagues which I have worked with before that all speak and write Spanish and do translations. One also does **Portuguese** translations. All 3 are my friends and they all live in South America. Only 2 are currently available to help but I am waiting to hear back from the 3rd person can take some time sometimes etc. Normally I get one person to do the English to Spanish translation and then another to check the work and it works well. I also have contacts in India and four more in South America too. One person has already forked the `APISIX` repo and created some translated text as a `test` of using and practising with GitHub. I need to sometimes assist them with Git and GitHub best practices as most people are newish to GitHub and not coders but technical writers, translators, virtual assistants, project managers, designers and graphic designers. Timezones are a lot different between the four us since I'm in `Australia` and they are in `South America` so sometimes there can be additional delays when doing tasks etc. I look at translating the docs to Spanish as a slow but **very fruitful** process and having a third language is a **great feature** and **important marketing effort** for APISIX. Spanish is a global language. Also I can help with some automated checking of English and Spanish translations using Google translate.</DESCRIPTION>
