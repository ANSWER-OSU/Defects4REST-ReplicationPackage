      <MESSAGE>[8] @ [DefaultPackagingImpl.java] [1 - REJECTED] [Avoid nested loops] INTENDED IMPROVEMENT: The key differences in the improvement include: 1. **FINDING-#1:** Replaced the nested loop for summing attribute weights with a Java Stream operation. 2. **FINDING-#2:** Replaced the nested loop for creating multiple instances of a product with `Collections.nCopies` for efficiency. 3. **FINDING-#3 to FINDING-#8:** Replaced string concatenations within loops with `StringBuilder` to improve performance. 4. **FINDING-#9:** The nested loop for fitting products into boxes remains, but early breaks are used to minimize iterations. These changes address the identified performance deficiencies by reducing the complexity and improving the efficiency of the code. DECISION: 1 - REJECTED REASONING FOR THE DECISION: The changes made to the code include: 1. Using Java Streams to sum up attribute weights, which simplifies the code but does not significantly improve computational complexity. 2. Using `Collections.nCopies` for product duplication, which is a minor optimization but does not change the overall complexity. 3. Using `StringBuilder` for logging, which improves string concatenation efficiency but is not a major factor in the overall performance. The core logic of iterating over products and fitting them into boxes remains largely unchanged. The nested loops for box assignment and product duplication still exist, and their computational complexity is not significantly reduced. Therefore, while the code is slightly more efficient and cleaner, the overall improvement in terms of computational complexity and efficiency is not significant.</MESSAGE>
