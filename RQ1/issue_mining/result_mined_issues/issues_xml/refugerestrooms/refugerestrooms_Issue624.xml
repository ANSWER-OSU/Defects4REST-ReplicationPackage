  <TITLE>.env file variable syntax is not compatible with latest docker-compose version 1.25.5</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>## The issue During project setup after cloning the project and installing docker, running `docker-compose` generated an error: ``` pierce@peridot refugerestrooms % docker-compose build ERROR: In file ./.env: environment variable name 'export DEVISE_SECRET_KEY' may not contain whitespace. ``` Others have run into[ similar issues](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6511) using `export MY_VAR=MY_VAL` in `.env` files, which are [compatible with `docker-compose` version 1.23.1 ](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6511#issuecomment-509873061). ## Scope / difficulty I anticipate this will be a straight-forward fix: updating the syntax of the variables as [outlined in the docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/#compose-file-and-cli-variables). ## Impact Updating `.env` will un-block setting up the project and support developers as they set up their development environment. ## Rationale I ran into this issue during project setup and I anticipate others may get blocked as well. ## Proposal Update `.env` variables so that they are compatible with the latest docker-compose version 1.25.5. ## How to actually do this: 1. Edit the `.env` file 2. Change variable declaration to be `VAR=VAL` format instead of `export VAR=VAL`. See Docker's docs on declaring default environment variables [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/#compose-file-and-cli-variables).</DESCRIPTION>
