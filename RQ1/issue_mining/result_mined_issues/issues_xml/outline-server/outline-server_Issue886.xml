  <TITLE>Can't remove unreachable servers from Outline Manager</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hey y'all :) My Outline Manager is currently in a weird state: - There are 2 unreachable servers (GCP, not Digital Ocean) in the Manager. - Their icons on the left sidebar keep spinning. - At first, clicking each icon shows the usual &quot;Connections&quot; and &quot;Settings&quot; tabs but with null/0/blank metrics. - Clicking the &quot;remove server&quot; menu item from the 3 dot menu doesn't do anything. - Eventually, I see this &quot;Server unreachable&quot; page (screenshot attached). - Clicking the &quot;Remove Server&quot; button doesn't do anything. &lt;img width=&quot;810&quot; alt=&quot;outline_manaager_bad_state&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/133466/116760851-1da62f00-a9e4-11eb-8c67-9b67d8774193.png&quot;&gt; I got into this state because I was experimenting with starting my own Outline server on GCP. When I restarted the GCE instance, the IP changed, and then this &quot;Server unreachable&quot; issue appeared. I re-ran the install script on the instance, added the new IP to Outline Manager, then again shutdown the server and then had a 2nd unreachable server. Outline manager version: 1.8.0 (1.8.0.4401) Thanks!</DESCRIPTION>
