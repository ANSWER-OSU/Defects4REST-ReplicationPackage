  <TITLE>Unable to add new server or remove old one</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I have created a new outline server. That works great. When I open the Manager to add it, the application hangs. Eventually it times out, but I cannot remove the old server, or add a new one. The application just hangs. I have tried uninstalling but this old instance is never removed. It would appear others on Reddit are reporting similar issues. https://www.reddit.com/r/outlinevpn/comments/mqo0g6/i_cannot_remove_the_server_from_outline_manager/ For me this is a show stopper as I cannot release it to the client until I can manage it. I am running MacOS 10.15.7. The Outline Manager version is 1.7.2 (1.7.2.4399).</DESCRIPTION>
