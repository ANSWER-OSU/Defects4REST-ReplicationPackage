  <TITLE>Unable to remove existing server in ubuntu</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>After I downsized the vps server in Google Cloud Platform, the existing VPS server IP got changed where the outline server is running. When I went into Outline manager and the item under &quot;Servers&quot; left sidebar where Outline server from Google Cloud Platform shows non-stop spinning icon. After for few seconds, the &quot;Server unreachable&quot; message shows up and I tried to click &quot;REMOVE SERVER&quot; and it didn't work either. ![Server unreachable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/295096/116792565-77435200-aae7-11eb-9d98-aeb8e2614b50.png) The Outline version number is 1.8.0 and I use Outline-Manager.AppImage to make it app runnable in Ubuntu. I attached both of the screenshots from Ubuntu. ![developer-tool-outline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/295096/116792570-81fde700-aae7-11eb-9496-3be17f387397.png)</DESCRIPTION>
