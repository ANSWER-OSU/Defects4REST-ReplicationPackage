  <TITLE>Easy to overwrite existing values in a database</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I just recently stumbled upon this project - it's great - to say the least. I just want to flag an issue with the dangers of people connecting this with production databases - and ease of which it automatically saves blanks over existing values in the user interface. Clicking in a column - and pressing CTRL-A (Select all) which would usually mean &quot;select all text in the column&quot; deletes the existing contents and there is no undo. If you exit the column the database gets updated with a blank value. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1555736/138466057-ed269471-3c79-4615-882b-34f3d340238a.png) After pressing CTRL-A ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1555736/138466593-7ab581ea-ea35-4eff-ba10-b4cba3587a24.png) This could cause people massive problems. I was on a test db, but was tempted to connect to the production after previously testing it out on a sample db - but had not seen this as an issue before.</DESCRIPTION>
