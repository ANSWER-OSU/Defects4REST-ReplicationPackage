  <TITLE>Bug: VIEWER can't receive form e-mail notifications</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Steps to reproduce - ORGANIZATION LEVEL CREATOR creates base, table, and form for it. - adds ORGANIZATION LEVEL VIEWER user to the base with role CREATOR - VIEWER opens the form and click on the &quot;E-mail me at user@example.com&quot; ### Issue: - Switch shows, as enabled, but actual request is HTTP 403 https://example.com/api/v1/db/meta/plugins/SMTP/status {&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;isPluginActive - : Not allowed&quot;} - Emails are never sent - If form reloaded - the switch is disabled Also, I haven't found a way for invited user (neither CREATOR nor VIEWER) to view or configure plugins. If the invited user is CREATOR, then e-mails are working, but still - no way to view or configure plugins. ### Desired Behavior VIEWER receive email notifications ### Project Details v0.204.0 in Docker with Postgres 16.1 with SMTP server on the same LAN: environment: NC_SMTP_FROM: &quot;user@example.com&quot; NC_SMTP_HOST: &quot;example.com&quot; NC_SMTP_PORT: 25 NC_SMTP_USERNAME: &quot;user&quot; NC_SMTP_PASSWORD: &quot;*****&quot;</DESCRIPTION>
