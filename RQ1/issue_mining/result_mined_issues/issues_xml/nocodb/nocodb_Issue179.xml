  <TITLE>Feature request : Import / Export file formats (CSV, JSON)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello ! My data is in a huge csv file (2M lines). I would like to import it into a table. Ideally it would auto-create a table, taking the column names from the first line of CSV. I would like to upload the file from my local disk, from my web browser. As a bonus, it would be nice to have flexibility on the CSV format : my file is using &quot;|&quot; as a separator rather than &quot;,&quot; (but I could transform my data before uploading it, so it's not a hard requirement. But it's preferable because I would like minimize the steps that I have to do in my workflow.) Thanks for this cool product !</DESCRIPTION>
