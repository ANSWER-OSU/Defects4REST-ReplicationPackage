  <TITLE>Bug: In GUI only first 20 items of Single Select and Multi-Select fields can be seen or edited/deleted</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Please confirm if bug report does NOT exists already ? - [X] I confirm there is no existing issue for this ### Steps to reproduce ? Create 1x Single and 1x Multi-Select columns. Create more than 20 Selctable items in each column (by editing Column Properties at the top). Save. Open and scroll down through the items that you just created in each column. You will notice that only first 20 items are shown and thus editable even if one scrolls to the very bottom of the list (i.e. the last item is always the 20th - no more items are shown/accessible in the list). It is imposiible to edit or delete any of single or multi-select items. ### Desired Behavior All items (including the ones beyond 20) should be seen/editable in item list of Single Select and Multi-Select columns. ### Project Details Node: **v18.18.2** Arch: **x64** Platform: **linux** Docker: **true** RootDB: **pg** PackageVersion: **0.203.2** Database version : **16.1** ### Attachments _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
