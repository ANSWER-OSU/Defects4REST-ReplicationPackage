  <TITLE>[Feature] Use column name in lookup instead of table/relation type</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>## Recommending Features **Need for this feature** Now that there is support for multiple linked records between tables, there needs to be a way to distinguish them in the &quot;Lookup&quot; dialog. Right now, you just see multiple relations, and it's not clear which is which **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** Cannot tell based on lookup dialog which relation is which, if there are multiple linked records between tables. **Describe the solution you'd like** Instead of just showing the table name and relationship type (or in addition to this), show the name of the column associated with the relation.</DESCRIPTION>
