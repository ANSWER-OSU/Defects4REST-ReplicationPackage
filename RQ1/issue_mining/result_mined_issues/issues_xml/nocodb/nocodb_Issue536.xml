  <TITLE>&quot;Editor&quot; role not allowed to upload files</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Node: **v12.22.1** Arch: **x64** Platform: **linux** Docker: **true** Database: **pg** ProjectOnRootDB: **false** RootDB: **pg** PackageVersion: **0.11.29** **Steps To Reproduce** 1. Log in as a user with &quot;editor&quot; role 2. In an &quot;Attachment&quot; field, try to upload or remove a file **Expected behavior** Editors should be able to manage attachments. Currently, one needs to be &quot;creator&quot; to do this. However, that role also allows users to change the table structure! This is surprising as &quot;editor&quot; is documented as &quot;Can edit records but cannot change structure of database/fields&quot;. Being a programmer, I know that attachments are stored separately and only referenced by the record. But I still consider them to be _values_, not part of the _table/database structure_.</DESCRIPTION>
