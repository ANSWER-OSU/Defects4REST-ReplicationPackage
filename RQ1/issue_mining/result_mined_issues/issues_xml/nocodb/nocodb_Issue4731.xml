  <TITLE>Feature: Support to delete rows in bulk</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Please confirm if feature request does NOT exists already ? - [X] I confirm there is no existing issue for this ### Describe the usecase for the feature Currently could not delete rows that satisfy a given condition. As the views will be the only source for our team to communicate with data, it would be nice to have this. instead of they again contacting the person with db access to do these type of operations. ### Suggested Solution provide an option to delete rows that satisfies the given condition. we can upload a csv and select a column all the rows that match the value in the column should be deleted. initially can support single column comparison and can later extend it to support different conditions and columns ### Additional Context _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
