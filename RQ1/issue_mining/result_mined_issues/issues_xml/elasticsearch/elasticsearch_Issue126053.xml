    <MESSAGE>Fix data stream retrieval in `DataStreamLifecycleServiceRuntimeSecurityIT` (#125667) This test seemed to fail because we would index another document before the master processed the data stream rollover - which is possible because non-master nodes expose the next cluster state a little bit earlier than the master node. Caused by #122852 Fixes #124978</MESSAGE>

      <MESSAGE>Add fallback in ILM to run cluster state steps periodically ILM sometimes skips a policy/index for a cluster state update if the step was still running/enqueued while the update came in. That on its own isn't a problem, but in very quiet clusters, this would mean that it could take arbitrarily long for the policy step to be run - i.e. when the next cluster state comes in. We saw this happening in a few tests, but it could potentially happen in production too. Fixes #125683 Fixes #125789 Fixes #125867 Fixes #125911 Fixes #126053</MESSAGE>

      <MESSAGE>Fix equality bug in `WaitForIndexColorStep` The `indexNameSupplier` was included in the equality and is of type `BiFunction`, which doesn't implement a proper `equals` method by default - and thus neither do the lambdas. This meant that two instances of this step would only be considered equal if they were the same instance. By excluding `indexNameSupplier` from the `equals` method, we ensure the method works as intended and is able to properly tell the equality between two instances. As a side effect, we expect/hope this change will fix a number of tests that were failing because `WaitForIndexColorStep` missed the last cluster state update in the test, causing ILM to get stuck and the test to time out.
