      <MESSAGE>[Test] Fix QueryableReservedRolesIT testQueryDeleteOrUpdateReservedRoles (#122803) Adds missing `assertBusy` in `testQueryDeleteOrUpdateReservedRoles`. We wait for security migration to finish before test execution, but this is not enough to guarantee that built-in roles are synchronized into the `.security` index. In many cases, the roles have already been synchronized before the query gets executed, but in rare cases the cluster is a bit slower and the assertion fails because the built-in roles have not been indexed yet.
