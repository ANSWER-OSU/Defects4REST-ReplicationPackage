    <MESSAGE>Retry ES|QL node requests on shard level failures (#120774) Today, ES|QL fails fast on any failure. This PR introduces support for retrying within a cluster when data-node requests fail. There are two types of failures that occur with data-node requests: entire request failures and individual shard failures. For individual shard failures, we can retry the next copies of the failing shards. For entire request failures, we can retry every shard in the node request if no pages have been received. On the handling side, ES|QL executes against a batch of shards concurrently. Here, we need to track whether any pages have been produced. If pages have been produced, the entire request must fail. Otherwise, we can track the failed shards and send them back to the sender for retries. There are two decisions around how quickly we should retry: 1. Should we notify the sender of failing shards immediately (via a different channel) to enable quick retries, or should we accumulate failures and return them in the final response? 2. What is the maximum number of inflight requests we should allow on the sending side? This PR considers failures often occurring when the cluster is under load or during a rolling upgrade. To prevent retries from adding more load and to allow the cluster to stabilize, this PR chooses to send shard failures in the final response and limits the number of inflight requests to one per data node</MESSAGE>
