      <MESSAGE>Disable queryable built-in roles feature for core and datastream YAML tests (#121541) This PR disables the &quot;queryable built-in roles&quot; feature for the `CoreWithSecurityClientYamlTestSuiteIT` and `DataStreamsClientYamlTestSuiteIT` YAML test suites. The feature was enabled by default in the #120323 PR, which asynchronously creates the `.security` index after cluster formation and indexes all built-in roles. The asynchronous creation of the `.security` index introduces non-deterministic behavior in our YAML tests. Since these test suites are not intended to verify the queryable built-in roles functionality, having the feature enabled introduced flakiness and unnecessary complexity to handle `.security` in existing tests. These tests would have to exclude the `.security` index in some way (by adjusting permissions or API calls), and in the end cleanup (delete) the `.security` index. This simply adds overhead without much gain. The feature is already test covered by `XPackRestIT` and other integration/REST tests, disabling it here would not compromise test coverage. Instead, it ensures these suites remain deterministic and focused on the behaviors they were designed to verify.
