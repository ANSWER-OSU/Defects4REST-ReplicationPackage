      <MESSAGE>Wrap emoji button in a div with tabindex -1 fixes https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/15295 This change is needed because by design Safari does not support focus on a button element. We have to keep the focus somehow otherwise we cause page jump in Safari when changing the icon. Tabindex -1 is a good choice because it does not mess with a tab sequence if we have one.</MESSAGE>
