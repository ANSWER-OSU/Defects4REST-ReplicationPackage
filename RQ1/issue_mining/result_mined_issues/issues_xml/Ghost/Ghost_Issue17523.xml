    <MESSAGE>Updated snapshots to include show_title_and_feature_image in event payload (#17378) no issue - Tests were failing for me locally because the snapshot for testing page event payloads didn't include the new `show_title_and_feature_image` property - Updated snapshot to include this property, which also changed a few content lengths and `x-cache-invalidate` headers as a side effect</MESSAGE>
