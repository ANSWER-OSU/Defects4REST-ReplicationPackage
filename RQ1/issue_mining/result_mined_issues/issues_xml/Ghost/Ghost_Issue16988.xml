  <TITLE>Admin panel filters for posts don't display posts for tiers.</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary An issue in two parts: 1) A bug. If a post is set for specific tiers access, the admin panel does not show it when any of the available dropdown options that should apply (members only, paid members only) are selected. The post only shows up when 'all access' is selected. 2) Perhaps a feature request. The Ghost admin panel doesn't have a dropdown to allow me to see posts by specific tiers. That'd be a logical thing to include. ![image](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/assets/42299862/35cd8f26-40dd-42b5-a2a4-94e27851f3f1) ### Steps to Reproduce Create a paid tier Assign some posts to it. (Restrict access to 'specific tier') Navigate to the posts page of the admin portal. Select paid members only or members only. The tier-restricted posts do not appear. I would expect tier-restricted posts to appear with these filters applied. I think the expected UI here would also include specific tiers as an option in that dropdown. ### Ghost Version 5.50 ### Node.js Version Ghost Pro ### How did you install Ghost?
