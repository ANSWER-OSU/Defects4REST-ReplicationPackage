  <TITLE>Quirky search behavior</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary I'm seeing some not-quite-right behavior from the sodo-search package, but having trouble coming up with a simple repro case. Here's what I've got: Run a search for 'fitness' at https://goodvibeswellness.com/ Scroll down. There are posts that actually match 'fitness', but the ui seems to get stuck with a bunch of posts that just match 'F' at the top. I can reproduce it for this site's content (when exported and imported locally), using sodo-search 1.3, and also 1.1. (That probably rules out the CJK changes being to blame.) I cannot reproduce it with another site running search at 1.1, nor on another site running search @1.3. Leaving this here in case anyone else is seeing something similar. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/193e392e-7bd8-467d-adfd-a2aad089e801) ### Steps to Reproduce see above ### Ghost Version search 1.1-1.3 ### Node.js Version varies ### How did you install Ghost? local &amp; ghost pro ### Database type MySQL 8 ### Browser &amp; OS version chrome, windows 10 ### Relevant log / error output _No response_ ### Code of Conduct - [X] I agree to be friendly and polite to people in this repository</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Fixed search state bug &amp; missing last result (#21417) closes #21343 This fixes an issue in sodo-search where early results (for example, matching the first letter typed in the search box) would get &quot;stuck&quot; in the display, due to failure to update state (or actually, lacking state). Converted PostItems to a component, and gave paginatedPosts state. I also fixed an undocumented bug where the last search result didn't appear, due to an error in with slice's register.</MESSAGE>
