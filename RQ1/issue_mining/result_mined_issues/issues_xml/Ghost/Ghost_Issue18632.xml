  <TITLE>Attempting to delete the first character of an italicised word deletes the HTML card below the paragraph</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary I've had this situation occur a couple of times now, the first occurrence of which I wasn't quite clear what was going on. But having this happen again I've been able to isolate the issue and reproduce it. That is, trying to delete the first character of an italicised word ends up deleting the HTML card below. The bug apparently doesn't occur when trying to delete any other character of the word, nor when trying to do a backspace on the final or any other character of the word. In the video below I'm hitting the delete key, then CTRL-Z, delete, CTRL-Z. https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/assets/27488257/4945a719-4e18-408b-992b-1ba6aa1859ac ### Steps to Reproduce 1. Create a paragraph and italicise one of the words in the middle 2. Create an HTML card below the paragraph 3. Move the cursor before the italicised word and hit the delete key 4. See the HTML card disappear ### Ghost Version 5.68 ### Node.js Version Yes ### How did you install Ghost?
