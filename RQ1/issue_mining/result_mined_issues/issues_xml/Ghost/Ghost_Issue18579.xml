  <TITLE>Dark mode bug with header in AdminX v5.69.0 at narrower width</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary It seems a header div is missing some details to implement dark mode at narrower width, as seen here: ![image](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/assets/25829/4a2223c8-5f08-4811-9733-eae49b51baa5) Seems like the header box should have a dark background but has white instead. ### Steps to Reproduce 1. Enable Dark mode for settings 2. Make browser narrower. ### Ghost Version 5.69.0 ### Node.js Version 16.20.1 ### How did you install Ghost? CLI ### Database type MySQL 8 ### Browser &amp; OS version Vivaldi and Qutebrowser (both Chromium-based) ### Relevant log / error output _No response_ ### Code of Conduct - [X] I agree to be friendly and polite to people in this repository</DESCRIPTION>
