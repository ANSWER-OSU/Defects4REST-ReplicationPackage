  <TITLE>Issue with '@page.show_title_and_feature_image is not used' error</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary Hello My latest version of the Reiro theme includes the aforementioned `@page.show_title_and_feature_image` helper, added in the `post.hbs` file, as below: ![Zrzut ekranu 2023-08-17 o 00 17 01](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/assets/23366922/8970fb01-2d4c-41b7-991d-bc672aa5de46) Unfortunately, despite this, many users experience an error when activating the theme. On my side, such an error no longer appears (localhost installation) and scan using GScan - gives no errors. So I am unable to answer why users continue to experience this error, despite the presence of a helper. So I am not able to give the steps for reproduction for this case. Therefore (if there is no solution) could I ask you to remove this error from GScan? Reason: This error relates to the Beta editor feature which is not yet an official release, this is a 'error' not a 'warning' which makes it all the more worrying for users (a lot of users don't even know that it is possible to activate the new Beta editor). Additionally when the helper is not used in a theme, there is already a nice message in the editor that explains why this function cannot be used: ![Zrzut ekranu 2023-08-17 o 00 28 01](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/assets/23366922/e1c74738-6817-4126-be9c-cfc1ff48840e) It seems to me that at this stage (Beta) this information is sufficient. So given the above, I would ask the Ghost team to consider removing the error message ### Steps to Reproduce Unfortunately, I do not know the exact circumstances why the error appears in some users, despite the fact that it is used in the theme. ### Ghost Version 5.59.1 ### Node.js Version v18.17.0 ### How did you install Ghost? localhost ### Database type SQLite3 ### Browser &amp; OS version _No response_ ### Relevant log / error output _No response_ ### Code of Conduct - [X] I agree to be friendly and polite to people in this repository</DESCRIPTION>
