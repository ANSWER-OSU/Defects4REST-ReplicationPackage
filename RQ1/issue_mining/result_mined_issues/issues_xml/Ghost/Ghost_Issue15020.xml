      <MESSAGE>Fixed internal css leaking outside for search refs https://github.com/TryGhost/Team/issues/1675 closes https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/15020 - the main css file used for search was accidentally imported in the root js script, causing it to be included alongside the final minified bundle and get injected outside the iframe. - the main css is pushed as a separate file outside of bundle and used directly as link inside the iframe instead</MESSAGE>
