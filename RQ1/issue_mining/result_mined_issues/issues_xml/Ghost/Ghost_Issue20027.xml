  <TITLE>Newlines not correctly handled in product card titles</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary If I press shift-enter while creating a title for a product card, then each line of the product title ends up in a separate span. I can publish and it displays without issues. (This is handy, because I might want to change how those spans are styled or laid out.) Everything is OK until I open the post a second time in the editor. At that point, the title is consolidated into a single span. Maybe titles shouldn't be breakable into multiple spans, but it'd be nice if the behavior (whatever it is) were consistent, and opening a published post didn't reformat it. ### Steps to Reproduce Create a product card. Give it a title that spans multiple lines. Publish. Observe the output of the post HTML, with the title in multiple spans. Open the post in the editor again. (Line breaks will be gone.) Save, without making other changes. Observe the output of the HTML, with the title now in a single span. ### Ghost Version 5.81.1 ### Node.js Version 18 ### How did you install Ghost?

    <MESSAGE>Made 5 settings quicker to edit at the top-level in Settings (#21976) Based on our changes to the _Access_ and _Analytics_ cards in Settings, we decided to update how we allow edits to a few other settings, too. These changes allow the following settings to be manipulated at the top-level in Settings, without having to click 'Edit' first. - Timezone - Default recipients for newsletters - Publication language - Social accounts - Tips and donations fixes https://linear.app/ghost/issue/DES-1062/updates-to-editsave-method-of-settings-cards</MESSAGE>
