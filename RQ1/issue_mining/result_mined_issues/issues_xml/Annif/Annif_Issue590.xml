  <TITLE>Simplemma analyzer</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Just like with spaCy (see #374) we could add an analyzer that uses [simplemma](https://github.com/adbar/simplemma/) for lemmatization. This is a very fast and lightweight multilingual lemmatizer which currently supports 38 languages. The lemmatization accuracy may not be as high as with e.g. Stanza (see #539) but in practice that doesn't seem to matter much based on experiments I've performed. Simplemma is implemented in pure Python without external dependencies so I think it should be possible to include this as a core feature, not an optional one, unless there are any unexpected problems with e.g. supported Python versions.</DESCRIPTION>
