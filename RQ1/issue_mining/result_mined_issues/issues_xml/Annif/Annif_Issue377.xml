  <TITLE>Use sparse arrays for subject vectors</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Currently subject vectors (wrapped by VectorSuggestionResult and ListSuggestionResult objects) are basic, dense NumPy vectors. These take up a lot of RAM, for example a single YSO vector takes about 40,000 subjects * 4 bytes (float32) = 160kB and these add up especially for ensemble backends (pav and nn_ensemble) that need to keep many such vectors in memory. SciPy sparse vectors would likely be much more space-efficient so we should (try to) switch to them. (related to #339)</DESCRIPTION>
