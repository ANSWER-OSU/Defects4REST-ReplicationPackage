  <TITLE>Updating avatar</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello, I like this addon very much, but can´t get one thing to work. I want to set my personal avatar with the command for updating profiles. Can anybody tell me what ist expected as &quot;string&quot;? I tried a path/filename to a .gif on my RaspberryPi in the size of 50x50 and had to learn, that I have to encode it in Base64. I did this using an online-tool, but this doesn´t work, too, but with no error. I found no tips how I can get it to work. This is what I mean: &quot;base64_avatar&quot;: &quot;string&quot; Thank you in advance! Dirk</DESCRIPTION>
