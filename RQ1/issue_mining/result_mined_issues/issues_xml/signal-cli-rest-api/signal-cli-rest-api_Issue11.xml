  <TITLE>License</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, your API looks quite cool and of course I think that you want to share your code, but as you state no license, technically no one is allowed to use it (without your explicit permission). **So, I’m sorry to bother you with this legal stuff, but would you please add a license of your choice to your project?** (Side note: It get's far more weird for every user of go packages as everyone has to comply with *all* licenses of every used go dep as go links (mostly) statically..) Thanks!</DESCRIPTION>
