  <TITLE>GetGroups should display member UUID if there is no number</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Feature Request In latest Signal versions it's possible to add group members without phone number. In this case member is added as UUID. But `/v1/groups/&lt;NUMBER&gt;` shows empty string for such members: ```json { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Group Name&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;group.SomeHashHere&quot;, &quot;internal_id&quot;: &quot;someHashHer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;+XXXXX&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;+YYYYYYY&quot;, &quot;&quot; ], &quot;blocked&quot;: false, ... } ``` `signal-cli` responses with [member UUID](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/blob/master/src/main/java/org/asamk/signal/commands/ListGroupsCommand.java#L47) in such cases. It would be useful if `signal-cli-rest-api` could return these UUIDs instead of empty strings. Thanks.</DESCRIPTION>
