  <TITLE>Link device API fails to link the device</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>When I tried to link my existing number to the signal cli running in a docker container using link device API, every-time after the QR scan, signal android app gave &quot;No device found&quot; or &quot;Network error&quot; toast and was failing to link the number. After searching through the internet I found similar issue reported here within another issue mentioned in below link: https://github.com/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api/issues/95#issuecomment-780006579 Since only workaround was given there which takes a while to search and apply, I'm raising this issue here again so it gets fixed and gets the link device API working.</DESCRIPTION>
