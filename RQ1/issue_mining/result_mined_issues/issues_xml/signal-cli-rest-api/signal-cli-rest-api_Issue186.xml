  <TITLE>error log spamming log-file</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### The problem Hi I've been using the docker container for about 6 weeks with success. after a power outage in my house, signal suddenly stopped working with the error message ` time=&quot;2021-12-04T14:51:13Z&quot; level=error msg=&quot;Couldn't read data for number +4xxxxxxxxxxxx: EOF. Is the number properly registered?` while i have not yet checked what the issue behind the error message is, i noticed that the container is spamming the log with the error message. by spamming i mean that the error is logged hundreds of times per second leading to a huge log file. in my case, the log file got to a whopping 360 gigabyte over a course of about 12 hours when disk space finally ran out and paralyzed the entire system. question: is this normal behavior or is there anything I can do to reduce the amount logging if this issue every reoccures in the future? (apart from limiting log size in docker itself) thank you! ### Are you using the latest released version? - [X] Yes ### Have you read the troubleshooting page? - [X] Yes ### What type of installation are you running? signal-cli-rest-api Docker Container ### In which mode are you using the docker container?
