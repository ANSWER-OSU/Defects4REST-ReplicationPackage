  <TITLE>Please provide a simple function to trust devices</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Subject says it all: I ran into the issue that signal-cli won't send any longer to some devices. Only digging in the logs gave me the hint that somehow signal-cli does no longer send to untrusted devices (why?). Now I have the hassle to enter the security number for all those devices in long curl calls. I appreciate Signal for all its security and privacy features, but I also appreciate that the security number stuff is completely optional on &quot;conventional&quot; devices. I don't really understand why signal-cli seems to enforce the validation, that's overkill IMHO. The command line client at least offers an option to trust a device without entering the security number. Can this feature made accessible via the api, too?</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>extended trust endpoint * added possibility to trust all known keys. This option doesn't require the user to provide a safety number, but insted all known keys are trusted. This option is obviously less secure and should only be used for testing. see #237</MESSAGE>
