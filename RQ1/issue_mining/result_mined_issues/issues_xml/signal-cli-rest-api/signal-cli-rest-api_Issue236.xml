  <TITLE>Setting name, avatar doesn't update name</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### The problem I'm in rpc-json mode and want to change the username my contacts are seeing. When i send a put request to the endpoint, i get 204 back and after about 1 minute, the avatar is update, but i still only see the phone number as the &quot;username&quot; in signal messenger on my phone. Is this an issue with this client or is there something i'm doing wrong? ### Are you using the latest released version? - [X] Yes ### Have you read the troubleshooting page? - [X] Yes ### What type of installation are you running? signal-cli-rest-api Docker Container ### In which mode are you using the docker container?
