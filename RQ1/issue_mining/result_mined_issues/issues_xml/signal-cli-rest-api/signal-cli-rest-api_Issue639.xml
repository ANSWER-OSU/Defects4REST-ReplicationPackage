  <TITLE>make https url configurable for swagger_url</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Feature Request Add a Environment variable that Swagger uses https instead of http. I'm using signal-cli-rest-api to replace the old signal-cli api from Asamk, because of the better attachment handling (not needing the file inside the container, when attaching something) Not that i rely hard on Swagger, but it would be nice if there was an option to tell swagger that it would be reached via https instead of http. It is possible to change the url at the top to get it to work, though.</DESCRIPTION>
