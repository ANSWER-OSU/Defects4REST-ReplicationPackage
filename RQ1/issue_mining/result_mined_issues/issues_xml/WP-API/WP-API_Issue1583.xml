  <TITLE>Avoid expensive Post-&gt;get_item call from Post_Terms</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Right now, `Post_Terms::validate_request` calls `$this-&gt;posts_controller-&gt;get_item`, although it actually only needs to check permissions. This is relatively expensive, as it means that when you're grabbing a post with embeds, it needs to prepare the post ~4 times for one request.</DESCRIPTION>
