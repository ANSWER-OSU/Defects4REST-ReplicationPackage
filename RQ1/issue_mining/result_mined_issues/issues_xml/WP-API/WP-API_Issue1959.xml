  <TITLE>GET request for media files results in an empty array</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi I have been trying to fetch all the media files from the REST API using restangular, but no matter how I try it fails, so I decided to test the media endpoint via PostMan app and realized that although I can see the media files json object in my browsers when I browse to /wp-json/wp/v2/media but using PostMan or using restangular it always results in an empty array. The funny part is that during the time I was pulling my hair for getting the media files, the files showed up only once, and after one refresh they were gone forever, this could be a bug in the wp rest plugin.</DESCRIPTION>
