  <TITLE>Remove multisite support from plugin (de)activation hooks</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Because `switch_to_blog()` doesn't load the full code context of a given site, flushing rewrite rules while looping through sites is unadvised — one can accidentally noop existing rewrite rules. It would be better to have an admin notice or similar if we want to flag the user to the fact they need their rewrites flushed.</DESCRIPTION>
