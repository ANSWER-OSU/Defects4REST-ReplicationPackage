  <TITLE>Approving a comment deletes content and author</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>_Bug:_ Changing comment status from hold to approved using a PUT request deletes the comment author and comment content. I am using the basic auth plugin and an $http request in AngularJS. _How to replicate:_ Add an unapproved comment to your site with the WP API v2 and basic auth plugins installed. Using Postman, send a PUT request with a basic auth header to a comment endpoint, such as mysite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments/54 In the form data, send along status=approved. The comment will be approved, but the comment author and comment content are deleted.</DESCRIPTION>
