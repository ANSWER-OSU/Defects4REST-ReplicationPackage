  <TITLE>Sorting by date returns sticky posts first</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, I realized that the default sorting that should be by date,desc actually returns the posts marked with &quot;{sticky: true}&quot; first (ordered by date,desc) and then the posts marked with &quot;{sticky: false}&quot; (ordered by date,desc). I think this is confusing, especially as I am using the API for syncing across platforms — this forces the system to always check the all the sticky entries first and then work on the actually new ones. Also I think it would be great to have the possibility to sort by modified date, desc. Would that be achievable through hooks? Thanks, Moritz</DESCRIPTION>
