  <TITLE>Unable query null values from elasticsearch in elassandra 2.4.2-6</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I'm using currently elassandra 2.4.2-6 and I cannot build a query to retrieve documents which *have a property with null value* I means, the document in elasticsearch which has not a property. I tried several approach suggested by elasticsearch's documentation * exists query https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.1/query-dsl-exists-query.html * null_value (set a value by default if the data is null) https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.1/null-value.html However in both cases I get no results data. Any suggestion? I try the same queries in Elasticsearch 2.1.1 and they work fine.</DESCRIPTION>
