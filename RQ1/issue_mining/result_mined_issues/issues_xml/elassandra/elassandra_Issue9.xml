  <TITLE>Cannot create index pattern in Kibana (cluster setup)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Has anyone else experienced any problems while setting up Kibana 4.3 while having multiple nodes? When using elassandra with just a single node, I'm able to setup the index pattern and see my data in Kibana as it's being loaded. However, when I try to do the same thing with several nodes, I cannot create the index (Kibana is able to find the index and recognize the Time-field name, however it doesn't do anything when I click create). Additionally, online it is posted that I should use the sed command as: sed -i .bak -e &quot;s/type: ${q}index-pattern${q}/type: ${q}index_pattern${q}/g&quot; -e &quot;s/type = ${q}index-pattern${q}/type = ${q}index_pattern${q}/g&quot; -e &quot;s%${q}index-pattern${q}: ${q}/settings/objects/savedSearches/${q}%${q}index_pattern${q}: ${q}/settings/objects/savedSearches/${q}%g&quot; optimize/bundles/kibana.bundle.js src/ui/public/index_patterns/_.js src/ui/public/index_patterns/_.js src/ui/public/index_patterns/*.js is repeated twice. In order to get kibana working on a single node, I also used sed on src/plugins/kibana/public/discover/controllers/discover.js. Note: I'm using elassandra 2.1.1</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>copy cassandra bin files at packaging time #3 Previously, cassandra binaries were copied from cassandra source code to Elassandra repository which leaded to outdated bins because it requires to manually keep the files synchronized. Now, bins are pulled at packaging time from the cassandra submodule.</MESSAGE>
