  <TITLE>Alerts and Status Queries</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>## Motivation When creating dashboards and continuously monitoring with re:dash, it's sometimes difficult for everyone involved to see if everything is okay with a quick glance. If there was some way to define conditions and queries to reduce this to an simple &quot;status&quot;: Good/Bad, it could be used in several interesting ways. The rest of this issue details a proposition on how this can be done. ## Status Queries Just like re:dash has queries for data tables and charts today, a new type of query can be created, which will output a single value. This value can be either binary (good/bad), ternary (good/warning/bad), or a continuous score between 0.0 (bad) to 1.0 (good). These queries could then be used in a variety of ways. ## Status Widgets Once a status query has been built, a simple widget can be used to display it. A few examples come to mind: - Stoplight (green/yellow/red): For binary/ternary query results. - Percentage text (0%-100%): For numeric scores. - Slider (vertical or horizontal): For numeric scores. ## Creating and Editing status queries Creating and editing status queries should be done in a fashion similar to today's regular queries, possibly using the same existing views. Specifying that this query represents a status value (binary/ternary/score) can be done explicitly or inferred implicitly from the result data (e.g. if a single value is output). ## Status Widgets in Dashboards Just like query views may be added to dashboards today, Status Widgets can be added to the dashboard grid as well - either standalone, or as part of a composite &quot;status view&quot; which displays several such widgets (this may be preferable since these status widgets don't require as much screen area as full-blown charts). ## Alerts for certain status query results Alerting rules may be defined on status query results. For example, if a certain binary query returns &quot;False&quot;, we may want to do one of the following: alert users directly to this change via in-site menus, email, desktop notification popup, or whatever. Having this feature will allow re:dash users not only to check product/system health at a glance, but be notified when these rule-sets are not being met, and start investigating (inside re:dash or elsewhere).</DESCRIPTION>
