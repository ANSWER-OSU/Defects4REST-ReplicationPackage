  <TITLE>Align &quot;widget requires access to a data source&quot; vertically</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getredash/website/ec722ae60241d9f80ad217e7af1600abce2686a2/static/assets/images/docs/gitbook/restricted-widget.png) Currently the message is aligned to the top. It made sense in the days when widgets had auto height. But now we should make sure it's vertically center aligned.</DESCRIPTION>
