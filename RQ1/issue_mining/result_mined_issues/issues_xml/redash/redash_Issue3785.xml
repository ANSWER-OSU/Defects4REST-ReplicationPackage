Have plotly visualization shown in query editor. 2. Click New Visualization and select Map (Choropleth). 3. You can make the plotly modebar of the underlying visualization to appear over choropleth map when you hover over where the plotly modebar exsists. Plotly `modebar` class has fixed z-Index of `1001`. Our `ant-modal-mask` and `ant-modal-wrap` both has z-Index of `1000`. Maybe we need to increase these to 1002 or more?</DESCRIPTION>
