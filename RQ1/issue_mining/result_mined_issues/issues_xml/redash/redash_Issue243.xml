  <TITLE>Load query results in dashboard with separate requests</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Currently when requesting dashboard data from the server it returns it with all the visualizations, queries and query results. While at first this seemed as a good idea (to have single http request), it has some downsides: 1. In case of large data sets, getting them all in one puts too much stress on the server. 2. In ability to use HTTP caching in case the same query is used for several visualizaitons or if it was loaded already (and the cache isn't stale). 3. It prevents &quot;progressive&quot; load, as data for all the queries needs to be downloaded before single visualization can be seen. Therefore let's change the API to return everything aside from query results. It might even be just a server change, as in theory, in the past this case was handled properly by the application (although a lot has been changed since).</DESCRIPTION>
