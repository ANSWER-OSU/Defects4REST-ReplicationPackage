See [here](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000331668&amp;type=1&amp;mode=1) for more information. ### Steps to Reproduce 1. Add Salesforce as a data source where a token isn't required (and cannot be generated) 2. Cannot proceed without required field ### Technical details: https://github.com/getredash/redash/blob/be56035bd6d9856361edc6b23d30a38c8f2d2be2/redash/query_runner/salesforce.py#L81 Just remove `token` from the `required` list. Seemed like it'd be faster to create an issue than submit a PR for such a small change</DESCRIPTION>
