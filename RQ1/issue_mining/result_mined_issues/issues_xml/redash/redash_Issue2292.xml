  <TITLE>Bar chart with second y axis overlaps data series</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Summary Discussion here: https://discuss.redash.io/t/bar-chart-with-second-y-axis-overlaps/1493/3. In a bar chart, when choosing to display a data series on the secondary y axis to the right, the data series overlaps all others: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2836636/35824246-2a6fe2e4-0aaa-11e8-9a62-959bab5928f5.png) It shouldn't. The correct solution is to display all data series side-by-side regardless of y axis. Example from google sheets: 1 y axis ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2836636/35824257-3921a82c-0aaa-11e8-86b4-3b68cc0e918c.png) 2 y axis ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2836636/35824266-3f0d3616-0aaa-11e8-8897-389669ecddb6.png) Occurs on v3. ### Steps to Reproduce 1. Create bar chart with at least 2 data series 2. Configure 1 data series to use a secondary y axis Any other info e.g. Why do you consider this to be a bug? What did you expect to happen instead? I don’t think that’s the correct behaviour a secondary y axis should have. Why would anyone want a data series to entirely cover up other data series? The objective of a secondary y axis is to allow very different ranges of values to be plotted on the same graph. ### Technical details: * Redash Version: 3.0 * Browser/OS: any * How did you install Redash: ubuntu provision script</DESCRIPTION>
