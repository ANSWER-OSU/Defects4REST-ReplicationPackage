  <TITLE>External API support</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>While 99% of re:dash functionality is exposed as API, it can only be consumed after signing in with a Google Account. We need to have some sort of API key scheme, where you can generate API key per user and per query (to allow access for single query).</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Install redash-stmo. In the long run we'll be able to install additional dependencies by having an own Dockerfile to build images based on the Redash image but that installs additional Python dependencies. But until we have a fork with lots of changes ourselves we need to do it this way. Redash-stmo contains the ability to hook up our own Dockerflow library. Refs #13 Refs #37</MESSAGE>

      <MESSAGE>Update Circle CI for our workflow - Use new master / rc release release strategy (#440) - Migrate Circle CI 2.0 (#488, #502, #923) - Install redash-stmo. In the long run we'll be able to install additional dependencies by having an own Dockerfile to build images based on the Redash image but that installs additional Python dependencies. But until we have a fork with lots of changes ourselves we need to do it this way. Redash-stmo contains the ability to hook up our own Dockerflow library. Disable test that tests the login page and the existence of the remote auth link there. We override this functionality for user experience reasons via redash-stmo and redirect from the login page to the remote auth URL. Refs #13 Refs #37</MESSAGE>
