This is related to [this](https://ant.design/components/table/#components-table-demo-expand-children) Antd feature. Basically having a &quot;children&quot; column name in a query is triggering the +/- button to appear. Can be an issue from Antd side, but creating the issue here so we have it mapped. ![children-column](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3356951/69486688-22e56e80-0e2d-11ea-9f71-38e2cdbea340.gif) ### Steps to Reproduce 1. Create a query with a column named `children` or use [this](https://redash-preview.netlify.com/queries/260) 2. Check it has an extra +/- button ### Technical details: * Redash Version: v8 * Browser/OS: Any * How did you install Redash: --</DESCRIPTION>
