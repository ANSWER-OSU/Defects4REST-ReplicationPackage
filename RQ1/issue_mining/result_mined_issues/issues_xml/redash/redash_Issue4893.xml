Originally this value was shown in v6.0.0 here: https://github.com/getredash/redash/blob/4780bd9c5ef212dd4c38bafb525abc991812d59b/client/app/pages/admin/status/status.html#L35 Now it's pulled in from the `/status.json` api in https://github.com/getredash/redash/blob/8010781f0d3d14260523e135a5abef0847714b9e/client/app/pages/admin/SystemStatus.jsx#L47 but the value behind is not set anymore in https://github.com/getredash/redash/blob/8010781f0d3d14260523e135a5abef0847714b9e/redash/tasks/queries/maintenance.py#L95-L101. Any other info e.g. Why do you consider this to be a bug? What did you expect to happen instead? ### Technical details: * Redash Version: 8010781f0d3d14260523e135a5abef0847714b9e * Browser/OS: Firefox macOS * How did you install Redash: Docker</DESCRIPTION>
