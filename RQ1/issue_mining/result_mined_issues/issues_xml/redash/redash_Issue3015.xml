  <TITLE>v6 Release Plan</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Time to start aiming at releasing v6! I created the [v6 milestone](https://github.com/getredash/redash/milestone/14) to track any remaining work and this issue for tasks related to the release. I hope that we can have a beta version by next week and a final release 2-3 weeks after. - [x] Fix all issues and merge pull requests in the milestone - [x] Update CHANGELOG ([diff](https://github.com/getredash/redash/compare/v5.0.0...master), @jezdez): #3112 - [x] Sanity tests for the current master When all issues are done: - [x] Create a release branch - [x] Create GitHub release and update `version.redash.io` - [ ] Announce beta version - [x] Forum - [ ] Twitter - [ ] Facebook - [x] Need to mention in upgrade notes: - [x] The need to upgrade first to v5.0.2, for smooth Celery migration - [x] The need to clear out the Celery queue (because by default v4 uses JSON instead of Pickle) After the beta is stable: - [ ] TBD.</DESCRIPTION>
