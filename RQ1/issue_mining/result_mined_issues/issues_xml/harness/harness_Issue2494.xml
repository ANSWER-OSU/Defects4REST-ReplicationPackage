  <TITLE>Drone agent without volume</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I don't have permission to make host bind mounts so I need another way to connect to the docker daemon from within the drone-agent container as mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` is not possible: ``` failed to update service drone-ci_drone-agent: Error response from daemon: access denied: no access to Service Create with [Host Bind Mounts], Service Update, on collection xxxxxxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx ``` I have tried to add environment variables `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY`, `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` and most importantly `DOCKER_HOST` but it doesn't seem like this is supported. Is it possible to avoid using `/var/run/docker.sock` and use the `DOCKER_HOST` directly? I've searched half the day and couldn't find a satisfying answer. If this is a feature you want to add I might be able to provide a PR with some pointers.</DESCRIPTION>
