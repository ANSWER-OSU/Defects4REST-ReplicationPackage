  <TITLE>follow button on 0.3?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I'm sure it's one of the minor things on the todo list for merging exp into master, but is there going to be a &quot;follow&quot; button for the 0.3 release? I know issue #382 asks for a slight tweak to the 0.2 behavior but I'm not sure what the status is for 0.3. I'd be happy to contribute it if it hasn't been done yet. I think it would basically be (in app.js): - insert follow button with JS variable `follow` (probably as a sibling to `#output`) - whenever websocket gets data scroll to bottom if follow is true (probably in the stdout.subscribe callback) - some css/less (position: fixed; right: 240px; bottom: 10px)</DESCRIPTION>
