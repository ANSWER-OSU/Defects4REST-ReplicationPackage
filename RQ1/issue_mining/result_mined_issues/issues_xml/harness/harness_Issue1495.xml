  <TITLE>REST endpoint(s) for querying builds based on branches</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>It would be great if there was a way to query for builds based on a branch. In swagger this would look like ``` /repos/{owner}/{name}/{branch}/builds: get: parameters: - name: owner in: path type: string description: owner of the repository - name: name in: path type: string description: name of the repository - name: branch in: path type: string description: the branch of the buil tags: - Builds summary: Get recent builds description: Returns recent builds for the repository based on name. security: - accessToken: [] responses: 200: description: The recent builds on the branch. schema: type: array items: $ref: &quot;#/definitions/Build&quot; 404: description: | Unable to find the Repository in the database ``` Additionally it may be useful to get a listing of all the branches that have been seen or maybe the latest build on a per branch basis. This would also potentially have the pagination ala #1494.</DESCRIPTION>
