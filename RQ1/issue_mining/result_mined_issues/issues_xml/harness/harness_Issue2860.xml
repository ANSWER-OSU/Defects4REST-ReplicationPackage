  <TITLE>Templating, shared YAML</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Drone should support templating so we can keep things DRY. I'm finding repositories essentially have nearly identical `.drone.yml` files. Adding support for basic templating such as [GitLab's include directive](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#include) would help keep pipelines more reusable. At the very least, Drone should support running a script to generate its full `.drone.yml` file before the run. There is an old 2 year old issue about supporting templating but it was closed without resolution.</DESCRIPTION>
