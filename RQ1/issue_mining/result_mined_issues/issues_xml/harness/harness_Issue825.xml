  <TITLE>Drone killed build</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi I have been trying out drone by setting it up using vagrant and an ubuntu 14.04 image. I managed to get everything running but it seems my builds keeps getting killed, ``` /usr/local/bin/drone: line 82: 48 Killed bundle install ``` This is always right around the 4-5m mark. The part it gets killed at usually takes awhile as its installing native dependencies but I haven't been able to get a successful build in drone. I tried increasing the timeout to some ridiculous setting but that didn't do anything. I also don't see anything in the drone or docker logs that might help. I'm running version 0.3.0-alpha.</DESCRIPTION>
