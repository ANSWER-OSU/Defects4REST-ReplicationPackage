  <TITLE>Build timeout in yaml</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The build timeout should be able to be set in the yaml. The settings area isn't available to most users so its not common knowledge that there is a build time out. Additionally if a build fails due to a timeout this should be reflected in the UI so you know whether you should increase the timeout.</DESCRIPTION>
