  <TITLE>[Proposal] support custom volume to mapping source-code when use k8s mode</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Dear all, Drone is an awesome CI/CD tool and we use it about 3 years. thanks again ! recently, we upgrade our workflow to work with Drone k8s build feature. but we found it's a little slow because when use k8s mode, drone-runner-pod always create a new volume mapping because pod and namespace name is random value.it's make sense. we should physical isolation different pod. but I think maybe we can set a volume to mapping source-code &amp; only for source-code. all pod work on same k8s node will share same path. this can save a lot of time.</DESCRIPTION>
