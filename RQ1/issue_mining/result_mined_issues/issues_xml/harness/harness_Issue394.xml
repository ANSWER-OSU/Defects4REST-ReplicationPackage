  <TITLE>Building from src, deb pkg upstart script fails</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>droned is called without a path. After building from source, the deb package that is created installed drone in /usr/local/bin (as well as in $GOPATH/bin), neither of which may necessarily be searched on a system's boot. Thus, initctl doesn't launch the job. ``` droned $DRONED_OPTS ``` I changed this to /usr/local/bin/droned and it started correctly.</DESCRIPTION>
