  <TITLE>Feature request: from_file and from_variable in plugins' settings</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi guys, you made an awesome product, I love it! There are some plugins that require large content to be passed in the settings, e.g. CI success message pattern. That is why the a feature I am missing is something similar to `from_secret` but `from_file` and `from_variable` in the settings of plugins. Example of what I would like to have: ``` steps: - name: image: plugins/telegram settings: message: from_file: .drone-telegram-message.md ``` I asked this on [discourse](https://discourse.drone.io/t/using-from-file-and-from-variable-in-plugins-settings/4010) but didn't get any answer, so I assume it is not implemented yet.</DESCRIPTION>
