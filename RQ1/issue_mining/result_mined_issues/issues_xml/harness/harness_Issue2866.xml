  <TITLE>drone server doesn't support custom port</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>For some reason I can not use the 80 and 443 port for the drone server, and I set the port when `docker run` &gt; --publish=8080:80 \ &gt; --publish=8443:443 I noticed that after some url redirection it failed. I found the `:http` and `:https` about port in the `drone/server/server.go`. It looks like the hard code and meaning not support custom port. Can you give some advice in my situation? Thanks a lot</DESCRIPTION>
