  <TITLE>Drone development and directions</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, We're considering using drone in our organisation. We have a basic setup working integrated with gitlab, and it works great. Our needs, however, go beyond what drone currently supports. We're thinking of using some of our time to seriously contribute do drone. In order to make a decision, we would like to understand what is the current development plans. I guess the first question would be: Whats you plan for the 0.4 release? It seems the two branches named after &quot;0.4&quot; have greatly diverged from master, with some big changes regarding builds and the database. Is 0.4 going to be released with all the work from those branches merged into master?</DESCRIPTION>
