  <TITLE>Git HTTPS Protocol - New Branch Creation Rule Not Blocking Push from CLI but Works via UI</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>## Description: When using the Git HTTPS protocol, I have set a rule to prohibit the creation of new branches. After cloning the repository locally and checking out a new branch, I am able to push the new branch without any restrictions from the command line. However, the UI correctly enforces this rule. Additionally, key scanning exhibits similar behavior; enabling or disabling it has no effect. This inconsistency is affecting our workflow. ## Steps to Reproduce: - Set up a rule to prohibit new branch creation on the repository. - Clone the repository locally using the HTTPS protocol. - Create a new branch locally. - Push the new branch to the remote repository via the command line. ## Expected Behavior: The push operation should be blocked due to the rule prohibiting the creation of new branches, consistently across both CLI and UI. ![image](https://github.com/harness/gitness/assets/8605565/e350606d-ee2a-473a-8983-14795c3a5949) ![image](https://github.com/harness/gitness/assets/8605565/888d62a1-7372-4a21-af85-a63cef38c00b)</DESCRIPTION>
