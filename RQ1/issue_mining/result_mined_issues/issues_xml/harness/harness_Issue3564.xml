  <TITLE>Production Deployment</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi Harness team - congrats on v3.0! I would love to start hosting Harness Open Source (love the rebrand btw!) for my lab, however I would prefer to do so in a &quot;production-ready&quot; manor. There's a few features which are either missing or undocumented, and it would be great to hear if they are planned on being public, or only accessible within your managed offering for large enterprises. These features include: - Highly available deployments of Harness (2-3 node clusters) - Distributed pipeline runners (running CI pipelines on other VMs, allows easier multi-arch builds) - SSO authentication These features would bring the platform closer in-line with other open source alternatives, such as GitLab. Absolutely love what you all are doing, and look forward to whatever comes next.</DESCRIPTION>
