  <TITLE>Gitness - Unauthenticated Git Pulls</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>When setting a repository to Public under Gitness (which is described as &quot;Anyone with access to the Gitness environment can clone this repo&quot;), browsing the repository via the Web UI is not possible, however, unauthenticated git pulls are. Personally, I'd be fine if Public on Gitness meant what Protected/Internal means everywhere else (if you can log in to Gitness, you can see and work with the repo), but this is a weird combination of both Public as in &quot;everyone in the world&quot; (can git pull), and Public as in &quot;everyone with an account&quot; (can see the repo in their browser)... Is this a bug, or is this intended behaviour? It might be worthwhile to clarify the note on the visibility level if this is intended - point out that you don't need an account to do a pull.</DESCRIPTION>
