  <TITLE>Suggestion: Use project directory name for workspace: base directory</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Using `src` as the default base path seems arbitrary. Would it not make more sense to use the projects directory name as the base as that is what the developer who created the project decided already? And I only say this because some tools do expect the project directory to be the same across builds. Just a suggestion. Perhaps it's too much of a breaking change - feel free to close.</DESCRIPTION>
