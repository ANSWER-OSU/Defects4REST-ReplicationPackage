  <TITLE>Build priority to master branch</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I like a lot that drone builds my secondary branches, but I would like to **_prioritize the builds on master branch**_, to speed up our CI and prod deployment time. Considering we are 5 devs on the same project, it happens all the time that we have 1 or 2 commits awaiting to be built on master, while other, lesser important or WIP branches are constantly taking over the consumers and slowing down the queue. There is something that can be done, apart from disabling all the secondary branches or piling up consumers?</DESCRIPTION>
