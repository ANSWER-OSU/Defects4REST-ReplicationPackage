  <TITLE>Drone Issue | Where is host volumes data stored in drone runner container?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I use self-hosted drone server and drone runner which all run in docker containers. I use host volumes features to set up cache for speeding up my building steps like this: ```yaml volumes - name: gocache host: path: /var/lib/cache/gocache ``` Everything works fine, building is much quicker than before. However, when I try to figure out where is the host volume data stored, I came into problems. I have only one drone runner, so I think my cache files will in my drone container, and its path will be `/var/lib/cache/gocache`. When I try to list with command `docker run drone-runner ls /var/lib/cache`, only `apk` and `misc` are listed. The cache works fine, but **where is the cache files actually**? I have no idea, could you offer to help? FYI: my drone runner version is `1.8.3`, while drone server version is `2.22.0`.</DESCRIPTION>
