  <TITLE>Need information about Gitness development stage</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>In the README it's mentioned: &gt; Drone development will continue in the drone branch until we a ready for our first tagged Gitness release, at which point the project will fully converge. I'm here to question about the current stage of Gitness development. I've tested it, and it worked well. However, couldn't find information in the README or the docs regarding whether it's production-ready. I apologize if I've missed this information.</DESCRIPTION>
