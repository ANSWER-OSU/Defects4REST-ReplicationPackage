  <TITLE>Distinct event trigger for Cron pipelines</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I can't skip some pipelines/steps during cron scheduling. When I use cron jobs, I can set pipeline trigger with cronjob name to include this pipline during cron execution. ``` trigger: cron: ['cron'] ``` But I can't exclude some pipelines/steps from all cronjobs. I tried to use something like ``` trigger: cron: exclude: '*' ``` to exclude cronjobs from common pipelines for pushing code to repo. But when i commit to repo, I'm getting `trigger: skipping pipeline, does not match cron job`. It would be nice to add event type 'cron' to avoid this problem. I think it'll look like ``` trigger: event: exclude: 'cron' ``` Thanks</DESCRIPTION>
