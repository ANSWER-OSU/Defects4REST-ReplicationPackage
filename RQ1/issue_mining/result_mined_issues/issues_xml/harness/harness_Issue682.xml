  <TITLE>&quot;Build&quot; when pull request is closed?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Apologies is this is just Not How Things Work, but is there any way Drone could trigger an abbreviated &quot;build,&quot; wherein nothing is actually built but there is a build record created, when a pull request is closed instead of merged? It's an issue I've been trying to deal with on the Drone Wall, wherein closed pull requests will just stay attached to a repo visually forever, since the only way we know to hide them is if they get merged. A closed pull request doesn't trigger anything in Drone, so it just stays up there forever. Right now I just hide any pull request that's been inactive for two days, but it's not ideal. So yeah, a one-line build with a status of &quot;Closed&quot; or something like that, doesn't actually re-build any code, but broadcasts that a change of state has occurred. Feasible? Not?</DESCRIPTION>
