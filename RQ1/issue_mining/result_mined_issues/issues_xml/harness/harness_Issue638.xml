  <TITLE>Safari 8 not rendering correctly</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I just noticed that if i open drone with safari, the sidebar is at the top instead on the right. I just did a quick crossbrowser compatibility check and it looks like also ie10 and other safari versions do have that problem: http://www.browserstack.com/screenshots/1a74b401f1bd022c21e6bc7fe9272bc694a8d55f If ie and safari is not supported by drone than this is not an issue.
