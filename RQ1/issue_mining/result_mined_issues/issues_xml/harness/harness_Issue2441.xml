  <TITLE>RFC: repo status per build step</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Summary This is a proposal to add the ability for every step in a Drone pipeline to be able to create a repo status. Currently only 1 &quot;global&quot; status is created for the entire pipeline (e.g. all steps together). I feel this could be extremely valuable combined with new ability to allow for a single step not to fail the pipeline (#2071). ### Goals Here are some goals I envision. There are details in each goal that could be tweaked, for example naming of things. * each status would update immediately after a step finishes (not waiting for an entire `group` to finish for example) * each status would link directly to the logs of that step inside the build * would be &quot;opt-in&quot;, meaning a step would not create a status by default but can be configured to do so from `.drone.yml` * allow to customize `context` for a step, defaults to `continuous-integration/drone/&lt;step-name&gt;` ### Example Pipeline ``` pipeline: # Does not create a status restore-cache: image: plugins/drone-s3-cache # Creates a status with default context lint: image: node group: test status: true commands: - lint command # Creates a status with default context test: image: node group: test status: true commands: - test command # Does not create a status rebuild-cache: image: plugins/drone-s3-cache # Create a status with custom context build: image: plugins/docker status: continuous-delivery/docker # Create a status with custom context deploy-test: group: deploy status: continuous-delivery/k8s/test # Create a status with custom context deploy-master: group: deploy status: continuous-delivery/k8s/master ```</DESCRIPTION>
