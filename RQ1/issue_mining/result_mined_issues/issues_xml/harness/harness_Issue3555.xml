  <TITLE>Drone Helm chart left abandoned.</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>there has been a few issues with drone for the past year when deploying with a helm chart. if you have an existing helm deployment and want to update it/redeploy it for some reason, either a configuration change or some other reason, the helm chart will never redeploy successfully. the pod will hang forever as it dosent know how to handle the service existing before the pod. this causes errors and the pod will forever loop, never deploying. this has been an issue for over a year, and due to the supposed razor focus on developing gitness, the drone chart has been left to rot.</DESCRIPTION>
