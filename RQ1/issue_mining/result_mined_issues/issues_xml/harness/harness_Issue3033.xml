  <TITLE>'When: Local: false' not working during local build</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Steps to reproduce: drone.yml: ``` yaml pipeline: not_local: when: local: false image: alpine:3.6 commands: - echo &quot;hello world&quot; ``` Output: ``` sh drone exec [not_local:0] + echo &quot;hello world&quot; [not_local:1] hello world ``` Expected: the step not to run when running drone locally. This is very useful for plugins.</DESCRIPTION>
