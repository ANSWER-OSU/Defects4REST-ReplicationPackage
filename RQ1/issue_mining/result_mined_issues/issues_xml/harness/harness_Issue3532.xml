  <TITLE>Feature Request: MFA or external authentication via OAuth2/OIDC</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, looks like a really interesting product you are building here. TL;DR: MFA and/or a generic OIDC solution would be awesome. The biggest issue that stops us from using this in a real way is security. It would be nice to have multifactor-authentication and/or external authentication (where we can have MFA). I did not find anything about this in the documentation but the way it worked in Drone was very nice, although I understand that signing in with a git-provider account kind of defeats the purpose here.</DESCRIPTION>
