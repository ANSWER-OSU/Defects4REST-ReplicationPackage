  <TITLE>Drone for Kubernetes not deleting local volume when finished</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>This issue is discussed here: https://discourse.drone.io/t/drone-leaving-directories-behind-in-kubernetes/4395 To summarize: the code exists for the controller drone-job to remove the `/tmp/drone/&lt;namespace&gt;` directory after a build is finished, but the drone job isn't created with a volume mount for the `/tmp/drone` directory, so it is ineffective. I'm mostly creating this issue to track a branch and link a PR. PR is here: https://github.com/drone/drone/pull/2694</DESCRIPTION>
