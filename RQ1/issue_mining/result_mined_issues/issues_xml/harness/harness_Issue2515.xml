  <TITLE>now that Github has disabled webhooks for more than 24h - force a new drone build?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello! First of all, I ignore if there is another way to do it, and I have tried with the cli... with no success. Is there any way to force a *new* build without a webhook? I mean Github is down now, and many of us would like to have a way to do a new build with whatever there is on a specific branch, a new build, not a rebuild of a past build, something like: drone build start etaleinc/etale-java-main again guys, is there any way to actually accomplish this?</DESCRIPTION>
