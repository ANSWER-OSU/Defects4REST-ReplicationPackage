  <TITLE>Issues with grep syntax</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello, I am having some issues with drone parsing a `grep` command in my pipeline. Essentially, I am using grep to pull a version number of one of my container images in order to promote the image from dev -&gt; stage and eventually stage-&gt;prod. I am doing this through `gcloud`. My command to grab the image using `gcloud` syntax is: ` gcloud container images list-tags &lt;my-image-repository&gt; --filter=&quot;tags:latest&quot; --format=&quot;table[noheading](tags)&quot; | grep -o '\bv\w*.*'` This command parses the correct information when I log directly into the docker container that I am using to execute this step, however, when I run it with Drone it appears to yank the `\b` from my grep command completely. I tested this with a pipeline by just running `grep -o '\bv\w*.*'` against a `test.txt` file that included a string `v1.0.30841303` and the pipeline fails out with the last step showing the following: `+ grep -o 'v\w*.*' test.txt` Is there something I am doing wrong or is there something in Drone that would cause it to incorrectly parse the `\b` in my grep syntax? Thank you!</DESCRIPTION>
