  <TITLE>Customize timeout before killing job?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>It appears that Drone is killing my very long-running tests. As a major incentive for using drone running on my own server was the ability to run CI test suites that would take more than 50 minutes to execute, it's rather disappointing to see Drone kill them anyway (if that is indeed what is going on -- the log is not very informative so I suppose other errors may be possible, all I see is `/usr/local/bin/drone: line 42: 321 Killed`) Do we / could we have some way to toggle the time a job is allowed to run before being killed?</DESCRIPTION>
