  <TITLE>Drone/Slack: Corporate Proxy</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi! We currently use Drone in our company and it works just awesome. We also use Slack in our team and would like to notify a slack channel of the build status. Currently, nothing happens with slack. We have set it up this way: ``` notify: slack: username: $$SLACK_USER token: $$SLACK_TOKEN team: $$SLACK_TEAM channel: $$SLACK_CHANNEL on_started: true on_success: true on_failure: true ``` And the environment variables are set in the repository settings on Drone. There is no output of the slack plugin. How can we have a more verbose logging output of Drone or the Plugin? Does Drone/The Plugin System/The Slack plugin support a corporate proxy? Our proxy is set via `HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY`on the machine.</DESCRIPTION>
