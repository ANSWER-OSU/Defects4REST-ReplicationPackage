  <TITLE>Pipeline Only Mode</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Given that Gitness builds on Drone, are there plans to allow someone deploying this to disable the git repo management side of this application? I tried Gitness for a good few months. but with it missing issues, projects, discussions, time tracking and all the other features my workflow requires, I decided to switch to Gitea and use Drone instead. now that I've been building out my repos and such in Gitea, I don't want to switch again even if gitness does end up getting all the features, I don't want to be in a situation where I'm forced to either switch to Gitness down the line or be stuck with Drone as it slowly decays from Harness' priority list. Basically, I'm asking if I should hold onto Drone until gitness launches, fully featured and replace Drone or if I should be looking to replace Drone now with some other CI/CD Pipeline system.</DESCRIPTION>
