  <TITLE>Provide (optional) Ability to Use Docker Swarm as the Container Orchestrator</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>With the ever-increasing popularity of Docker Swarm, I would love to see Drone runners interacting with the Swarm API or Drone using the Swarm natively for example when deployed within a Swarm stack etc. What I would like to do is to create services with Swarm mode replicated-jobs using Drone. Are there any works in development or future plans in the backlog? For example, launch a service called `ci-build` that has several tasks (replicated-jobs) such as `clone`, `frontend`, `backend`, `publish` etc. Current Drone features such as parallel steps would stay the same. In this case, `frontend` and `backend` tasks can be executed at the same time while `publish` `depends_on` both. The integration with Swarm would bring a lot of scalability, serviceability and portability benefits to Drone. This is just a simple use case I can think of right now but I am sure the community can benefit this integration in many different ways. There already is an entry in the forum which is long forgotten since 2018 :) https://community.harness.io/t/swarm-runtime-for-drone/8456</DESCRIPTION>
