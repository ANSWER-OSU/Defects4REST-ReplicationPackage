  <TITLE>Drone container linking problem [0.3.0-alpha]</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, i am trying to work with drone and I have a problem with services. i have to set of integration tests that runs agains a mongodb database. My drone file is this one: ``` image: wdalmut/php:5.5 services: - wdalmut/mongo:2.6 script: - echo &quot;date.timezone=Europe/Rome&quot; &gt; /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini - echo &quot;memory_limit=512M&quot; &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini - curl -Ss http://getcomposer.org/installer | php - php composer.phar install - bin/phpunit -c app ``` The script section works correctly and the container is correctly prepared and executed. Same things for the MongoDB service that is effectively started as described in my `.drone.yml` The problem is that containers are not linked and my testing scenarios cannot connect to mongodb using &quot;locahost:27017&quot;. I have also inspected both containers and there is no linking between them. I checked out the docs and i see that the `.drone.yml` is correctly configured. There is anything that i'm missing? Thanks Walter</DESCRIPTION>
