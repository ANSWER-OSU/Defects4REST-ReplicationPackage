  <TITLE>empty page on GitHub login redirect</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I've setup a local Drone environment for Docker image testing. I'm able to login and work with the interface. A colleague of mine tried to login as well, but gets stuck on a redirect happening after initial login on GitHub. The redirect URL is as follows (changed the keys): `http://ourdrone.com/api/auth/github.com?code=26314215f822zadcc8ebe&amp;state=HLISSI2IG44RPACYZ6IJM55ZL63N7IUAONPHI3HNZAGSTRGN52NQ%3D%3D%3D%3D` After the white page, we checked GitHub and Drone is actually authorised on his account. We also tried logging in again, this time GitHub redirected right away (due to already given access), but still a white page came up. Our drone instance is configured like this: ``` [github] client = &quot;xxx&quot; secret = &quot;xxx&quot; orgs = [&quot;blendle&quot;] ```</DESCRIPTION>
