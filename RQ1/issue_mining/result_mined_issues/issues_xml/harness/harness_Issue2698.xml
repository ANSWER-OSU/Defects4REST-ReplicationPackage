  <TITLE>RFC: don't inject drone env variables to plugins container by default</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The plugin system is really great. And undoubtedly, docker image as plugin is a more advanced way because of portability. It could be a revolution in the whole CI ecosystem. People can share these plugins across CIs. But then I realize one thing, Drone injects its own env variables to the plugins container by default. And all env variable names start with DRONE_ prefix. This design breaks the portability across CIs, which could be better. I prefer not to inject all env to the container by default. Instead, people should fully control what variables they want. For example, `GitHub Pages` use some default env variables, required or option. [DRONE_REMOTE_URL](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-gh-pages/blob/master/main.go#L64) is a required variable. In my mind, it should be named as `PLUGIN_REMOTE_URL`, and be transferred by user. ```yaml steps: - name: publish image: plugins/gh-pages settings: username: from_secret: github_username password: from_secret: github_password pages_directory: public/ remote_url: $DRONE_REMOTE_URL ``` This can pull out `plugins` from specific `Drone` system, and can make plugins more easy to test and use.</DESCRIPTION>
