  <TITLE>Config parsing is failing</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>config.Parse called in main.go during startup often fails with an no such flag error. `no such flag -github-secret` The exact flag it fails on varies by run, but this causes the env variables to be ignored and the app to often not start up at all.</DESCRIPTION>
