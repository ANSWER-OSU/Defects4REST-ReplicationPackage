  <TITLE>Run one build on two CPUs</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I don't know if it's currently possible but I want to use the full potential of my server by running a build on two CPUs. With my actual config I can run two builds simultaneously but when I have only one build running (and it is what happens most of the time) it can use only half of the power of my instance. Can we configure Drone to launch docker container with the good configuration for that ? Maybe something like the docker config `CpuSet` ? We have an heavy build that take 30 minutes to run, to divide it by 2 would be very great to improve the feedback loop of continuous integration.</DESCRIPTION>
