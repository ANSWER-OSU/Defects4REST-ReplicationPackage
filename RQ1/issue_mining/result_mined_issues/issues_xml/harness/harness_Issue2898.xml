  <TITLE>[feature] ytt templating of .drone.yml</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>From my perspective, [ytt](https://get-ytt.io/) is more approachable than jsonnet and even starlark. It has many of the same benefits of the other two but doesn't require completely switching to a new DSL for basic language features. Being able to have drone render yaml with ytt would be a welcome improvement.</DESCRIPTION>
