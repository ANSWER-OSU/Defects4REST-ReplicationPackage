  <TITLE>Re-adding private BitBucket repo fails</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>If you attempt to re-add a private repository it fails, and the error shown in &quot;docker logs&quot; is &quot;Unable to add Public Key to your BitBucket repository: Bad Request.&quot; Deleting the key under &quot;Deployment Keys&quot; in BitBucket.org and then retrying adding the repository in Drone works, which suggests that the failure is because it's not checking to see if the key already exists.</DESCRIPTION>
