  <TITLE>Problem with BitBucket</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>hi, wanted to try drone today in combination with BitBucket. Sadly did not have very much luck. Used the latest docker-container (0.4) and followed the instructions. First it seemed to work fine. After I pressed &quot;Login&quot; it displays me the repositories and when I then click on one, it tells me that it has to get activated first. So I press &quot;Activate Now&quot;. That is when the problem starts. Because all I get then is the following error message: ``` Unable to activate this repository. You must have administrative access to this repository. Also, please check the third-party application access policy to ensure Drone is approved. ``` In the browser console I get: ``` http://localhost:8800/api/repos/janoberhauser/drone-test: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error) ``` and in Docker: ``` Error #01: Bad request ``` To be sure I really gave it all the access-rights there are. So that can not be the issue. Also was I totally unable to find any kind of third-party application access policy in BitBucket. I guess that is only in GitHub. So anybody any idea what is going wrong. Is there maybe something wrong with the container because it is just 19h old. Thanks!</DESCRIPTION>
