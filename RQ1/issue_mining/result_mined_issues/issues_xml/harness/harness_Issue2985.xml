  <TITLE>Multiple Application Links on Bitbucket Server override one another</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello, We've got multiple drone deployments pointing to the same Bitbucket Server. The issue is that these application links seem to override one another. Creating / Updating one seems to alter/squash the other. Is there a workaround here? Can we change the name of the Application Link and the name of the Service Provider maybe?</DESCRIPTION>
