  <TITLE>instructions how to start contributing?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I have tried to find good instructions to how to start contributing drone. It seems that there is not really good instructions to this? I am currently trying to build drone-server that I could test my new code features, but I cannot find how to do that. I tried to follow this https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/master/BUILDING but it does not build any binaries? Then I tried to understand what is happening in this file https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/master/.drone.sh#L22 However, I do not have access to drone-enterprise repositories, so I cannot build drone-server at all? So my question is: could someone make clear instructions how to build drone-server that we could verify code changes?</DESCRIPTION>
