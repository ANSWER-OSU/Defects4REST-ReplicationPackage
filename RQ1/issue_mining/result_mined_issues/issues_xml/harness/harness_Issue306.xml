  <TITLE>Archive build artifacts in Drone</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The existing artefact support is great for downloads, but it would be awesome if you could specify one or more directory to host as HTML after the build. As it is, you'd have to push these assets elsewhere during the build, which complicates things and is less ideal for proprietary codebases.</DESCRIPTION>
