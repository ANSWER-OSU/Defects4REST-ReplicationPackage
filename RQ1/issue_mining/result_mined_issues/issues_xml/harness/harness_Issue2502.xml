  <TITLE>[Feature Proposal] New Github Checks API support</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Github introduced Checks API few months ago https://blog.github.com/2018-05-07-introducing-checks-api/ . It looks like it supports features like direct code annotation and kicking-off re-run without leaving Github.com . I haven't looked in detail and don't know what would take for Drone to use this API (especially direct code annotation), but looks like worth investigating.</DESCRIPTION>
