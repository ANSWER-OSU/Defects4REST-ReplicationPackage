  <TITLE>Extend YAML to allow Docker Parameters for Services</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Let's say you want persistence for your `postgres` service ``` yaml services: - postgres docker: name: project_awesome_redis volume: {{awesome_volume}}:/var/lib/pgsql/data ``` Or maybe you want to your services and build container to share the same network namespace (no linking) ``` yaml services: - davetucker/drone-ovs docker: name: project_awesome_ovs docker: - net: container:project_awesome_ovs ``` There are potentially a lot more use cases, but these are the two that I can think of right now.</DESCRIPTION>
