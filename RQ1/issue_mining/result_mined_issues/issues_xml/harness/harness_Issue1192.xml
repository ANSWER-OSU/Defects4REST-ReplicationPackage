  <TITLE>Error &quot;tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake&quot; when accessing site</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I set up a new drone server by downloading the .deb. When I surf to it, my browser downloads a small binary file. Running drone from the command line shows the following when I try to access the page: ``` root@tetrad:/etc/ssl/certs# cd root@tetrad:~# droned -config /etc/drone/drone.toml 2015/09/06 19:33:54 http: TLS handshake error from 208.70.50.7:36073: tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake ``` I double-checked my cert files, and they both appear normal, and are used by other services on the box without problems.</DESCRIPTION>
