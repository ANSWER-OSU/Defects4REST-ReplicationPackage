  <TITLE>Selective email notifications</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Is there a way to receive selective email notifications? I am not interested in seeing &quot;yes, your build is still green&quot; stuff, yet absolutely care to know the following: 1. build failures 2. or, even better, changes in the build status This stuff is done quite well in Travis CI. Is there a way to configure at least (1) on Drone? Thanks!</DESCRIPTION>
