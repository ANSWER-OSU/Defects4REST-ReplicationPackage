  <TITLE>bump go to go-1.4 in drone.io</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>hi there, not sure this is the right place to send this but... it would be great to bump the go version served by drone.io to go-1.4. many of my projects require a few interfaces introduced with 1.3 (while drone.io still serves `go1.2`) thanks, -s</DESCRIPTION>
