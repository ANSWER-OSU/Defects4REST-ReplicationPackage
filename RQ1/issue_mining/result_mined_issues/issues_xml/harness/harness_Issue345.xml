  <TITLE>Refactor Publish and Deploy Code</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Currently the code which publishes and deploys application to external services relies heavily on the container having certain dependencies like python and a posix compatible shell installed. You can see an example of this failing due to the lack of dependencies in #344. I would like to refactor this part of the codebase. This can be fixed by moving all of the publishing and deployment code to go instead of [writing silent commands to the buildfile](/drone/drone/blob/master/pkg/plugin/publish/swift.go#L57). My idea is to have the code which deploys the application have access to a `docker.Client` instance which it can use to send commands the container and access the file system. Any thoughts or ideas are welcome.</DESCRIPTION>
