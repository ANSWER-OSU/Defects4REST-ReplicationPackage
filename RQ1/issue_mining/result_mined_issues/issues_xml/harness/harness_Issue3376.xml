  <TITLE>Gitness on Docker Support/Docs</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Trying to use the Docker version of GitNess - I have it up and running but.....!! 1. Would be great to have an ARM version of this to run on RPi 4 2. Running up on Intel not sure what port 3001 is for! I assumed SSL but this does not seem to offer SSL connection 3. On creating new REPO for testing the Clone URL shows Localhost:3000 instead of the external address I used via Traefik I am coming from using Gitea and thought I would give this a try but 3 above is a significant issue which I presume is a matter of an environment variable not set - but I could find not documentation relating to that hence the issue.</DESCRIPTION>
