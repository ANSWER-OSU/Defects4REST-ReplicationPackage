  <TITLE>Clone other private repositories using Netrc file</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>It would be great to be able to inject a pre-defined SSH key into containers. As part of our build process, we pull down dependencies that are in private GitHub repos. Currently there's no (easy) way of accessing these repos from Drone. This could be resolved by adding the ability to generate an SSH key that's used by containers (copied to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`), which we could then add as the deploy key for our dependencies.</DESCRIPTION>
