  <TITLE>Push docker image to multiple locations</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We are building a platform that uses Drone for CI and building Docker images. We would like to push some docker images to more than one repository on bintray. As it stands right now, we can only push to one location, limiting our functionality. It would be great to be able to specify more than one docker push destination</DESCRIPTION>
