  <TITLE>Build promote: Display environment</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>With drone 1.1.0 I can promote (previously called deploy) a build with: ``` drone build promote [command options] &lt;repo/name&gt; &lt;build&gt; &lt;environment&gt; ``` where I can specify a target environment. In the web interface however, I can't seem to find out which environment a build has been promoted to. I only see: ``` user-xxx promoted `branch` ``` I would like instead: ``` user-xxx promoted `branch` to `env` ``` (or any other way to display that info.) I remember drone 0.8 used to display target environments when running a `drone deploy`. Thanks</DESCRIPTION>
