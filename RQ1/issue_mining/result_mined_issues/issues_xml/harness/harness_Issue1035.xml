  <TITLE>use travis-build to parse a YAML file</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We're considering moving to drone for our CI https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/issues/974 But we have a few questions that I couldn't find answers to in your documentation: 1. can you take a `travis.yml` file defined in the project to define the various build stages for a simple sequential pipeline? (using the same rules for reporting and so on). 2. can remote workers be set up with a simple ssh login? What permissions does the user need to have? I believe the travis file goes too far... it should not be used for setting up the system environment (that's the job of the docker image). In shippable, a new section called `docker_image` allows the definition of the docker image to use, which I think is ideal.</DESCRIPTION>
