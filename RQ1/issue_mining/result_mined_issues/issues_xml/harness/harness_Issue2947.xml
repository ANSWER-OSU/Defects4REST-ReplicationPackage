  <TITLE>Windows exec runner</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, I'm getting `Host key verification failed.` when trying to clone a repository through ssh protocol. In cmd and PS it clones it without any problem. First I thought maybe it's the user, and I went and changed it on Computer Management -&gt; Services -&gt; drone-runner-exec to be run as local user not `SYSTEM` user. Same thing. Then I went and ran drone-runner-exec.exe (btw it does not have `.exe` at the end when one downloads it) directly on cmd.exe; but same thing. Interestingly runner gives `msg=&quot;cannot accept stage&quot; error=&quot;Optimistic Lock Error&quot;` and on server output is: `Host key verification failed.` from git command. Please help, Regards</DESCRIPTION>
