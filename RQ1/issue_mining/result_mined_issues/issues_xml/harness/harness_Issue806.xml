  <TITLE>What's the use case for the CLI versus the web UI (as admin)?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Not an issue but more of a question; what's the purpose of the commandline tool as opposed to using the web UI as an admin? I'd like to better understand the distinction between the two - it seems that some actions (e.g. disable a repo) would be desirable in the UI, but I feel I'm missing some context.</DESCRIPTION>
