  <TITLE>BitBucket integration not working</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I've pretty much followed everything here: http://readme.drone.io/setup/config/bitbucket/ The process itself is (as it should be) trivial, however it's not working. After logging in to Drone through BitBucket, the returned URL is &quot;/api/auth/bitbucket.org?oauth_verifier&quot; (with a key and token), which results in a completely blank page. Additionally /var/log/upstart/drone.log also appends an empty line with a timestamp. I'm using the latest .deb build on Ubuntu.</DESCRIPTION>
