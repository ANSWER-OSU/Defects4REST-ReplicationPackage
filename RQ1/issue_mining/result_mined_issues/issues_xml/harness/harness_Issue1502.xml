  <TITLE>Separate GitHub commit statuses for PRs and pushes</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Travis-CI has separate `.../pr` and `.../push` commit statuses, whereas Drone does not. There is a reason these should be distinguished: A PR build is run against the result of merging the head of the merge source into the head of the merge base; a branch (&quot;push&quot;) build is simply run against the head of the branch. Thus, in the case of a PR, the PR build actually tests what will land on the merge base, whereas the branch build does not necessarily test this; currently Drone will run both builds, but the results will just overwrite the same commit status, so the status you end up with will randomly depend on which build ran last.</DESCRIPTION>
