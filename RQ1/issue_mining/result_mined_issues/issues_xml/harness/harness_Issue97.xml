  <TITLE>Drone shows me the previous build for the same commit</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I have to branches on my repository, develop and master. I pushed one commit on develop, drone built it, and all specs passed. Next, I merged develop into master and pushed it to github. Drone is now building the master branch, current status is building, but if I click on the build, the previous build (from develop) is shown.</DESCRIPTION>
