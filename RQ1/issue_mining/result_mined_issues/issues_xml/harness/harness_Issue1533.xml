  <TITLE>View for only activated repos</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The list of repos in the main view of drone can get very long, and it's difficult to tell which are actually active. This is a suggestion to split the repo screen into 2 - one that shows only activated projects and one that shows you all where you can choose to activate any of them.</DESCRIPTION>
