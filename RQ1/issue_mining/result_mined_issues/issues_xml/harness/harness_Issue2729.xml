  <TITLE>In a pull_request event, DRONE_COMMIT_MESSAGE is using the description instead of the title</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I am using GitHub with Drone 1.1 and I have some logic similar to [CI SKIP] bound to the pull request title. As far as I understand, drone uses the pull request title for `DRONE_COMMIT_MESSAGE` in case of `pull_request` events. Everything works well when the pull request description is empty, but as soon as I add a description, it gets set to `DRONE_COMMIT_MESSAGE`. Interestingly, the pull request title is still shown in the drone UI. `env` doesn't show any variable which would still contain the pull request title.</DESCRIPTION>
