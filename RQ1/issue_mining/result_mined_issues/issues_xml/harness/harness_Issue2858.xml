  <TITLE>What's going on with the discourse?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello. Today I've found out that my account was blocked for spam for a year. However, there was no spam at all (show me and others then, if you think there was spam). I was helping others, asking others for the help as well. Could you please explain what has happened and fix this mistake? You've also deleted some of my comments and posts, I don't understand what was the point behind all of this. Don't you just feel like answering people's questions, helping them? Thank you. Also, from [this comment](https://discourse.drone.io/t/drone-agent-port/5914/4): &gt; the runner ports referenced in the documentation are for the new runners, which are developed and maintained in separate repositories. Does that mean that the documentation has already been partially updated for new runners and so we shouldn't pay much attention to it right now? Because there are installation instructions for &quot;drone/agent&quot; docker image but the documentation has already been partially written for new &quot;drone runnners&quot;, is this correct? Thank you.</DESCRIPTION>
