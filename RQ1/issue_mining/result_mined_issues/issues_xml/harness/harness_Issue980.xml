  <TITLE>Option to specifiy the hostname/url of the drone instance</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I`ve been trying to get drone running behind an apache installation in which I only have access to .htaccess files and mod_rewrite proxy options. drone always detects the internal address (localhost) and internal port and passes it on to github/bitbucket So instead of using drone.domain.com drone passes localhost:PORT to the github api. It would be great to not only have an option to specify the port for the server, but also the domainname / ip address. (currently I use a dirty hack by hardcoding my url into /shared/httputil/httputil.go</DESCRIPTION>
