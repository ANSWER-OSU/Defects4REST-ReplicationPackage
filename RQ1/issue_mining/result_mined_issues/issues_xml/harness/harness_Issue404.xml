  <TITLE>0.3 Release, Re-add GitLab integration</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>This was removed because we completely changed how Drone works. We remove the Drone username/password in favor of 3rd party login. GitLab, however, does not support OAuth. My proposal: 1. user enters their GitLab username / password in Drone 2. Drone uses the GitLab API with username / password to verify identity 3. Drone creates account, stores password in Auth Token field The above flow is for a new user. For an existing user: 1. user enters their GitLab username / password in Drone 2. Drone uses the GitLab API with username / password to verify identity 3. Drone sees user account exists, updates password in Auth Token field (in case it changed) Typically I wouldn't advocate entering a username / password in Drone for a 3rd party system. However, GitLab doesn't give us much of a choice. Furthermore, both GitLab and Drone are open source and self-hosted, so there shouldn't be any security implications.</DESCRIPTION>
