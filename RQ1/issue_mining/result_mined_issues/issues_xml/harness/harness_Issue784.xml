  <TITLE>Drone CLI don't exit container</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>This was a question that came up on gitter that I wanted to open an issue for. cc @maxim &gt; is there a way for me to start an image by hand and get a checkout in it, so i can debug some stuff? If i just enter a docker image I don't get the repo checkout. &gt; so something like &gt; 1. launch image with /bin/bash entry point (i can do this) &gt; 2. run drone pre-script stuff in it &lt;- need a way to do this &gt; 3. play around in the container Today we can use the `drone build` command to run a build locally, however, it exits as soon as the build completes. It would be nice if there were an option to drop you in a bash prompt inside the container after the build is complete for further troubleshooting. I believe this is something we can achieve with the `bash --init-file` option. We would run the build script as an init file, dropping you to the prompt once complete.
