  <TITLE>RFC: Service detach until</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Graph Execution is awesome! What about add limit for service execution? For example i need database and other infrastructure only for testing, but testing is not end of pipeline. I want to free resource immediately as it no more necessary. ```yaml --- kind: pipeline type: docker name: default steps: - name: database image: mariadb detach: until: - unit - e2e - name: install image: node commands: - npm install - name: unit image: node commands: - npm test - name: e2e image: node commands: - npm e2e - name: build / push / deploy / notify / something else ... ```</DESCRIPTION>
