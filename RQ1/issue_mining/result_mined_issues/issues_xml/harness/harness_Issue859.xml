  <TITLE>Jenkins Env Variable Compatibility</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Per https://github.com/drone/drone/pull/858#issuecomment-71968729 we should consider adding environment variables to match other CI systems (specifically Jenkins). Below is what the old version of Drone used, which I think is a good starting point. We intentionally omitted some environment variables (like `SVN_REVISION`) since they aren't as relevant today as when Jenkins was created. - `JOB_NAME`: the name of your project (github.com/:user/:repo) - `WORKSPACE`: the location of your code and working directory of your build script - `BUILD_URL`: the url of your build (drone.io/github.com/:user/:repo/:build) - `BUILD_DIR`: the location of your code and working directory of your build script - `BUILD_ID`: the current build number - `GIT_COMMIT`: the commit hash currently being built - `GIT_BRANCH`: the branch currently being built cc @craigtracey</DESCRIPTION>
