  <TITLE>[gogs] Incorrect resolution of relative &quot;avatar_url&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Drone is showing all broken images as avatars for repositories from Gogs source. I've seen it's due to relative URLs being found in &quot;avatar_url&quot; element of the `api/v1/orgs/orgname` endpoint, for example: `&quot;avatar_url&quot;:&quot;/gogs/avatars/6&quot;` Drone is turning that into an url relative to the Drone url, not the Gogs url.</DESCRIPTION>
