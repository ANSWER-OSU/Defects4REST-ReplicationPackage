  <TITLE>[Feature Request] Ability to change the name of a current project/repo</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Allow changing the name of an org or repo name. This seems like a good candidate for the cli. Something allow the lines of ``` drone repo update --full-repo-name=newproj/supercat1 proj/supercat ``` would move the repo to the new name. @bradrydzewski I'm not sure if this is really feasible but I'm willing to give it a go. from what I can tell critical things would include in the repo table - repo_owner, repo_name, repo_full_name *unknowns- repo_link, repo_clone in the builds table - * unknowns if it even matters but build_link, build_remote (I doubt these would matter nearly as much as the ones in the repo table)</DESCRIPTION>
