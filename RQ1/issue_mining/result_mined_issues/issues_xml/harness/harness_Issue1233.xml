  <TITLE>Timeline grouping and incorrect rendering</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The build timeline has a few minor rendering issues when appending builds received by the websocket. So in other words, the page is rendered correctly when first loaded, but may have trouble appending builds to the list. Right now new builds are appended to the latest group in the timeline. There are two known issues with this approach: 1. websocket receives the very first build, and no existing group exists 2. websocket receives a build, but the last group does not match the build date. The build is therefore appended to the wrong group **note** this is a known bug that I will probably defer because it is considered relatively minor compared to some of the other issues out there. I would love a volunteer to not only resolve these issues, but to also help improve our front-end code as a whole. If you are interested please get in touch in our [gitter room](https://gitter.im/drone/drone).</DESCRIPTION>
