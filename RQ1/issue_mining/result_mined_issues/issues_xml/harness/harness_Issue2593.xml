  <TITLE>Run pipeline on cancel/timeout</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Creating a feature request as suggested [here](https://discourse.drone.io/t/is-it-possible-to-run-a-clean-up-task-after-a-build-has-been-canceled/2528/3?u=s0undt3ch). The background to the feature request is as follows. We have a build with a few pipelines that create AWS resources and in the end, after success or failure, those resources are destroyed. However, if the build is canceled, there's no chance to run any cleanup code which means AWS resources are left running _ad-eternum_ because, on our scenario, not all devs which can cancel builds have access to AWS to terminate said resources by hand. Doing it by hand also defeats the CI automation process :) The request is to add support for running a pipeline on `cancel` the same way there's support for `success` and `failure`.</DESCRIPTION>
