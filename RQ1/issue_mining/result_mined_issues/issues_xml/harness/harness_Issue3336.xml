  <TITLE>Use Org. Templates and Secrets by Admins of Project/s in BitBucket DataCenter (On-premise)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello all!, We are running Drone, with license, for some time (3-4 years), everyone is happy with the platform and the possibilities, and now the users start becoming more enterprise-focused. They want to use the Organization templates and/or secrets and standardize some of their pipelines, but here we face an issue that we cannot solve, they must be admins of drone, although they are Admins of the Project in Bitbucket DataCenter (on-premise). But, we don't want them to manage the users of drone. Perhaps you don't know it, a Project in Bitbucket is a set of repositories, that can have a centralized RBAC. Our goal, as CI/CD platform provider, is to delegate to them the creation and maintenance of these Organization's templates and secrets. Did I miss any configuration in drone's deployment? If not, Could you review if it is feasible in your architecture? Cheers, Miguel</DESCRIPTION>
