  <TITLE>Ability to delete logs (in case you accidentally expose a password in your logs)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Drone should implement some basic log parsing for the web UI so secret exposure can be fail-safed. This would be implemented by treating specified secrets as an array of &quot;do not print&quot; words, and scrubbing them from the log output. While there is an obvious vector here of weak-passwords being highlighted by emitted text, this is marginal compared to the benefits of &quot;failing safe&quot; for the common case, and could be mitigated by assigning secrets as &quot;fail if appears in logs&quot; by default (which you should never really need to turn off).</DESCRIPTION>
