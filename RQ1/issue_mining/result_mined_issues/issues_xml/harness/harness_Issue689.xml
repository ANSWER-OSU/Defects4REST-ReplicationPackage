  <TITLE>deploying multiple artifacts via SSH</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Deploying multiple files via SSH is annoying as all of a sudden the deploy mechanism switches to zipping the artifacts. I think the zipping should be independent of the number of files, or removed alltogether. When one wants a zip they should create it in the `script` section themselves. The current implementation is very unintuitive and forces users to implement the `scp` call themselves.</DESCRIPTION>
