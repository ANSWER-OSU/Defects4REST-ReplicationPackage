  <TITLE>In-progress builds aren't visible to valid team members</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>In our test environment we have 3 people who have access to the same repo. Each has selected vokalinteractive/repo in the Repositories list. When User A triggers a build, User B and User C see nothing in the dashboard whereas User A see's the in progress build. When the build completes, User B and User C see the final build result. It seems like two things would vastly clear up the user experience here: 1. Why do additional users need to select the repo in the repositories list to see it in their dashboard? This is contradictory to work across a team, especially since it shows up as green/selected in the repos list for the new users already. 2. In-progress builds should show up for all members of the team rather than only finished build statuses. This is enormously beneficial given that we have roughly 40+ repos on a given team in our organization. When a build is running it should be as easy as jumping into Drone to see what builds are pending.</DESCRIPTION>
