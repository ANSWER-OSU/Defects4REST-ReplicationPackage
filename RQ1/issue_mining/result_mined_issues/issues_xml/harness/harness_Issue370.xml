  <TITLE>Incorrectly formatted .drone.yml will cause the individual commit page to load over and over again</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I had `{token}}` instead of `{{token}}` in my `.drone.yml`. This manifested itself in a weird way, which is that the individual commit page reloaded over and over when I viewed it. I fixed the missing opening curly brace and the page doesn't reload every second or so anymore. Seems like there needs to be some better validation of the configuration file.</DESCRIPTION>
