  <TITLE>Drone .deb package requires lsb_release to install cleanly on Debian 8</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>When installing Drone with the .deb package on a completely fresh Debian 8 install, the user is prompted with the following message: ``` $ dpkg -i drone.deb Selecting previously unselected package drone. (Reading database ... 13553 files and directories currently installed.) Preparing to unpack drone.deb ... Unpacking drone (0.3.0-alpha-1438588567) ... Setting up drone (0.3.0-alpha-1438588567) ... /var/lib/dpkg/info/drone.postinst: 20: /var/lib/dpkg/info/drone.postinst: lsb_release: not found /var/lib/dpkg/info/drone.postinst: 20: /var/lib/dpkg/info/drone.postinst: lsb_release: not found /var/lib/dpkg/info/drone.postinst: 24: /var/lib/dpkg/info/drone.postinst: lsb_release: not found Your system This system is not supported, you can install service manually ``` Installing the `lsb-release` package and trying again features no errors, so adding to the `Depends` should fix this.</DESCRIPTION>
