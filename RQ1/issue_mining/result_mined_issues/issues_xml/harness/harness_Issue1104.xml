  <TITLE>Documentation?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Is there a canonical source for Drone's documentation? The README links to http://readme.drone.io/usage/overview/ (which in turn links to http://drone.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ which is dead) and https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/v0.2.1/README.md#builds which seems outdated. My googling also turned up http://docs.drone.io/ which doesn't seem up to date or is for an unreleased version of Drone. For example, I can't find this screen anywhere in my own installation: ![build script](http://docs.drone.io/img/build-script.png) So... where should I go to find Drone documentation? Am I correct in thinking that Drone (the open source project) has been abandoned in favour of http://drone.io (the commercial hosted service)? Or is Drone open source development going to continue? I'm not complaining and there's nothing wrong with either decision, I'm just a bit puzzled.</DESCRIPTION>
