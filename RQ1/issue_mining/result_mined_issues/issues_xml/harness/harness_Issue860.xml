  <TITLE>Gogs Private Repos</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The current Gogs implementation works for public (open source) repositories only. We need a way to upload ssh keys to the repository in order to clone. Ideally we would also have a way to see if the key already exists, and either update or delete and re-upload. We'll need the Gogs team to expose this functionality. For reference, this is the code we use for GitHub: https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/master/plugin/remote/github/helper.go#L233:L255 @compressed thoughts?</DESCRIPTION>
