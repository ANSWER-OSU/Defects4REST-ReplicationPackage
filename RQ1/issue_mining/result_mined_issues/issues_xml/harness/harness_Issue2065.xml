  <TITLE>Agent does not automatically recover from network failure</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>This issue needs more research, but is here for tracking purposes. It may be possible under certain network conditions (usually when a reverse proxy or lb is involved) for network connections to terminate but not properly close. For this we should consider a heartbeat or timeout. cc @patrickjahns Some symptoms for this issue could include: - Builds not being pulled from queue - Build status not being updated with the server I will be locking this issue because there is nothing really more to say here.
