  <TITLE>Release 1.0</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Prepare the project Do some housekeeping on GitHub in the [main repo](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore). - [x] Close remaining issues for the version (including merging corresponding pull requests if suitable) or assign then to the next one. - [x] Assign all issues that were closed for an upcoming version (including a wildcard version like &quot;1.0.x&quot;) to this version (milestone). ### Prepare the code Update the source so everything looks like on the new version. - [x] Update `master` branch automation to use tags for deployment - [x] Rename `dev` to `main` - [x] Create a `release/&lt;version name&gt;` branch out of `main`. See #7236 - [X] Update code generation templates in `OrchardCore.ProjectTemplates`. - [X] Update the `OrchardCore.Commons.props` file: Update `VersionPrefix` for release versions (like &quot;1.0.0&quot;) and `VersionSuffix` for pre-release versions (like &quot;rc2&quot;, for the full version to be e.g. &quot;1.0.0-rc2&quot;). - [X] Update module versions in `ManifestConstants`. - [ ] Change docker version in GH workflows - [x] Create release tag on `main` to deploy on NuGet.org ### Test the release Make sure everything works all right. - [x] Make sure that [OrchardCore.Samples works](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Samples). - [x] Test the [guides](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/guides/) with the NuGet packages from the Cloudsmith feed (branches under `release/` are automatically published too). Test at least the following guides: - [Creating a modular ASP.NET Core application](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/guides/create-modular-application-mvc/) - [Creating an Orchard Core CMS website](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/guides/create-cms-application/) - [Creating a new decoupled CMS Website](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/guides/decoupled-cms/) - [x] Test the migrations from RC2 to release. Refer https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/issues/8753 for sample database ### Prepare and publish Orchard Core Translations Update everything in the [Translations project](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Translations). Only do this once all the code changes are done since localized strings can change until then. - [x] Update GH workflows - [ ] Nuget package properties: https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Translations/issues/61 - [x] Update .po files with [PoExtractor](https://github.com/lukaskabrt/PoExtractor). This will also update [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/orchard-core). - [x] Verify translation by referencing the MyGet feed and the latest packages locally. - [x] Publish the new version on NuGet. - [x] Update the `OrchardCore.Translations.All` package reference in the main repo's _src/OrchardCore.Build/Dependencies.props_ file to refer to the new NuGet package. ### Prepare the documentation Update the docs so they contain information about the new release so once the release is out you'll just need to point to new information. - [ ] Create release notes in a specific documentation section. You can take the previous release notes as a template. - Overview of the release's highlights and goals. What do you want people to remember this release for? - Prerequisites. What framework version do you need, anything else to work with Orchard? - Upgrade steps, any migration necessary from previous versions, breaking changes. - Full changelog. You can generate this with [github-changelog](https://github.com/cfpb/github-changelog) with the `changelog OrchardCMS OrchardCore &lt;previous version&gt; &lt;current version&gt;` command, e.g. `changelog OrchardCMS OrchardCore 1.0.0-rc2 1.0.0`. Alternatively, you can use [Antoine's app](https://github.com/agriffard/Changelog.OrchardCore) too. ### Publish the release Do the harder parts of making the release public. This should come after everything above is done. - [x] Merge `release/&lt;version name&gt;` to `master`. - Merges to `master` need two approvals so you'll need to create a pull request. - Merge it as a merge commit, not squash merge. - [x] Tag `master` with the full version name, including the prefix and suffix (e.g. &quot;1.0.0&quot;). - [x] Test the [guides](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/guides/) with the packages now automatically published to NuGet. Test at least the following guides: - [Creating a modular ASP.NET Core application](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/guides/create-modular-application-mvc/) - [Creating an Orchard Core CMS website](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/guides/create-cms-application/) - [Creating a new decoupled CMS Website](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/guides/decoupled-cms/) - [x] Update [Try Orchard Core](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/TryOrchardCore). ### Publicize the release Let the whole world know about our shiny new release. Savor this part! These steps will make the release public so only do them once everything else is ready. - [x] Update the documentation to mention the version in all places where the latest version is referenced, for example, but not limited to (do a search for the package version string): [Status in the root README](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/#status), CLI templates, commands, the [Creating a new decoupled CMS Website](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/guides/decoupled-cms/) guide. - [ ] Update the tagged [release](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/releases) on GitHub: Change its title to something more descriptive (e.g. &quot;Orchard Core 1.0.0&quot;), add a link in its description to the release notes in the documentation (something like `For details on this version see the [release notes in the documentation](link here).`). Add a link to this release under [Status in the root README](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/#status). - [ ] Publish a blog post on the website. - [ ] Ask to publish a blog post on [DevBlogs](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/). - [ ] Ask to publish a blog post on [.NET Foundation News](https://dotnetfoundation.org/news). - [x] Tweet</DESCRIPTION>
