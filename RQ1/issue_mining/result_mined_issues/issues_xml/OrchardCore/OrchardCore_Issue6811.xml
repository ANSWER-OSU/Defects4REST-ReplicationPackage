  <TITLE>Consider giving the localization module an explicit (negative) order to ensure it's always invoked early enough</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Currently, the localization module doesn't play well with the new OpenIddict 3.0 beta3 built-in localization support as it's not invoked early enough to have a chance to set `CurrentCulture`/`CurrentUICulture` before OpenIddict returns an error message. @jtkech any idea what would be an ideal value for `Order` here?</DESCRIPTION>
