  <TITLE>Add description to content types</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. I created `StudentGoal`, `StrengthGoal`, and few other content types, where each have an attached `BagPart` that would allow the user to add multiple notes to each goal. I also created `StudentGoalNote`, `StrengthGoalNote`, and other notes to allow a user with permission add notes &quot;different kind of notes&quot;. The reason I have multiple different note types is because I want to different roles to have different permission (some roles my be able to add a specific note but not all type of notes.) However, since these `StudentGoalNote`, `StrengthGoalNote`, and others are nothing but note to the user, I want the display name to be &quot;Note&quot; so it makes sense on the UI for the user. Below is a screenshot from the admin panel ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24724371/172496903-a08a6a57-ccbd-4193-a22e-d7c1592bf849.png) The above looks good and does exactly what I want. However, since all these notes have the same display name, this makes the content-type UI not friendly. Note this is not a duplicate problem, each of these note serves a different purpose but should be called &quot;Note&quot; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24724371/172497452-9f5ed4d6-2bfa-4678-bb4c-a80476d710ed.png) ### Describe the solution you'd like If the Content-type have description like `ContentPart` does, this would solve the problem and I would be able to add a description to the Content-Type describing what each note actually is used for. If this something would be accepted, I would submit a PR.</DESCRIPTION>
