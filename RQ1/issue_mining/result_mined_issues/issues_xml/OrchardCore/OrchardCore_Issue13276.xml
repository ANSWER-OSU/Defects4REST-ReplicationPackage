  <TITLE>Filtering by a role that contains space does not return result in the Users UI</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Describe the bug The role filter in the Users UI does not return records if you filter for a role name that contains a space. reason that breaks is we create a filter that looks like this `role:role name` but it should be `role:&quot;role name&quot;` ### To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Create a role with a name that contains a space 2. Give at least one user access to the new role. 3. Go to the users UI, use the filter to filter by the new role. I am guessing this issue exists into all any filter “including contents filter” where the filterable value contains a space. We should wrap every filterable value with double quote when the value contains at least one space.</DESCRIPTION>
