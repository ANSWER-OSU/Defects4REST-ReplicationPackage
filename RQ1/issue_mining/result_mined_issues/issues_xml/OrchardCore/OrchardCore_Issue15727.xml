  <TITLE>Issue with Menu Items via the Admin Panel - Adding More Than One Child Item Not Working</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>When trying to add more than one child item under a parent menu item then saving it reverts back to its original position in Admin. I of course need to be able to add more than one item in a dropdown menu. Examining in the Inspection window, it seems that maybe the Javascript isn't assigning the correct attribute values. See attached screenshot. (It may appear from the screenshot that it worked, but as soon as I &quot;Publish&quot; it reverts the position of the second child item back to the top level) &lt;img width=&quot;1468&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 6 44 10 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/assets/7737516/c8dd67ad-036f-40e6-b247-28b01a8c7929&quot;&gt;</DESCRIPTION>
