  <TITLE>Release v2.1.7</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION># Release Patch Preparation Guide ## Step 1: Backporting Pull Requests 1. **Identify Pull Requests**: Review any pull requests (PRs) that need to be backported to the release branch. These should be PRs that strictly contain bug fixes and nothing else. 2. **Backport Pull Requests**: For PRs merged into the `main` branch that need to be applied to the release branch (e.g., `release/2.1`), comment on the merged PR with `/backport to release/2.1`. This comment will trigger a GitHub Action to create a new PR with the same changes for the `release/2.1` branch. 3. **Merge PRs**: Once all necessary PRs are created, merge them into the `release/2.1` branch. ## Step 2: Code and Documentation Updates - [x] From the release branch (e.g., `release/2.1`), create a new temporary branch for the version (e.g., `release-prep/2.1.1`). - [x] Update version references in the documentation and code. Refer to [this PR](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/17065/files) for an example. The easiest way is to start with a search &amp; replace on the previous version. Version Updates Checklist: - **Update `OrchardCore.Commons.props`**: Set `&lt;VersionPrefix&gt;&lt;/VersionPrefix&gt;` to the new version you're preparing for release. - **Update Module Versions**: Modify `src/OrchardCore/OrchardCore.Abstractions/Modules/Manifest/ManifestConstants.cs` to reflect the new version. - **Release Notes**: Finalize the release notes in the documentation, including: - Highlights and goals of the release. - Prerequisites for running the new version. - Upgrade steps and any breaking changes. - **Update Documentation Navigation**: Add the release notes page to the `mkdocs.yml` navigation and remove it from `not_in_nav`. - **Version Mentions**: Update all references to the new version throughout the documentation, including: - [Status in the root README](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/latest/#status) - CLI templates and commands. - Relevant guides, such as the [Creating a new decoupled CMS Website](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/latest/guides/decoupled-cms/) guide. - [x] Create a **version PR** titled `Release &lt;version number&gt;` (e.g., `Release 2.1.1`) from the version branch (e.g., `release/2.1.1`) into the release branch (e.g., `release/2.1`) - [x] In GitHub, manually run the `Preview - CI` workflow on your branch (NOT `main`). This will release a new preview version on Cloudsmith for testing. ## Step 3: Validation - [x] **Check Functionality**: Update [`OrchardCore.Samples`](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Samples) to the latest preview version generated in the previous step (just change the `OrchardCoreVersion` property in the root `Directory.Build.props` file). Ensure the samples work as expected. - [x] **Test Guides**: Test the following guides with NuGet packages from the Cloudsmith feed: - [Creating a modular ASP.NET Core application](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/latest/guides/create-modular-application-mvc/) - [Creating an Orchard Core CMS website](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/latest/guides/create-cms-application/) - [Creating a new decoupled CMS Website](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/latest/guides/decoupled-cms/) - [x] If everything looks good and all checks pass, merge the version PR. ## Step 4: Creating the New Release 1. Navigate to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/releases/new). 2. In the &quot;**Choose a tag**&quot; menu, enter the new version number, including `v` (e.g., `v2.1.1`), and select &quot;**+ Create tag: v... on publish**.&quot; 3. Change the target branch from `main` to the release branch (e.g., `release/2.1`). 4. Enter the version number in the Title field (e.g., `2.1.1`). 5. Click **Generate release notes** to auto-generate release notes. 6. Add a link to the release notes on the docs site: `Check out the full release notes [here](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/latest/releases/2.1.1/).` 7. Ensure the &quot;Set as the latest release&quot; checkbox is checked, then click **Publish release**. ## Step 5: Aligning Branches **Merge to `main`**: After releasing the new version, merge the release branch into the main branch to ensure `main` contains all administrative changes. - [ ] Create a pull request from the release branch (e.g., `release/2.1`) into `main`. - [ ] Resolve any merge conflicts using external tools (e.g., Fork) to avoid auto-merging `main` into the release branch. **Important**: DO NOT resolve conflicts using GitHub's interface; that will automatically merge `main` into the release branch, which must be avoided. - [ ] Merge the PR if all checks pass. If there are merge conflicts, then you'll need to merge to `main` manually using the following steps: 1. Fetch the latest changes from the Git repository. 2. `git checkout` the `main` branch. 3. Merge the release branch (e.g., `release/2.1`) into `main` with a merge commit (NOT a squash merge). Use the commit message pattern `Merge release/2.1.1 to main`. 4. Resolve any conflicts. 5. Push the changes to `main`. This action requires a user with the ability to force-push into `main`, as it is protected by default. 6. GitHub will automatically delete the release branch; to restore it, go back to the new merged PR. ## Step 6: Housekeeping - [ ] Assign the milestone for the release version to this issue. Create one if it doesn't exist. - [ ] Assign the milestone to the issues that were released in the version. - [ ] Close the milestone. - [ ] Update [`OrchardCore.Samples`](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Samples) to the newly released version (just change the `OrchardCoreVersion` property in the root `Directory.Build.props` file). ## Step 7: Publicizing the Release - [ ] Post about the release on X (formerly Twitter) via the [Orchard Core X (Twitter) repo](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard-Core-X-Twitter). - [ ] Post in the [Orchard Core LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13605669/). - [ ] Post to the [Orchard Core Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/OrchardCore/). - [ ] Send a message to the `#announcements` channel on Discord.</DESCRIPTION>
