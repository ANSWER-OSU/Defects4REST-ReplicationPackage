  <TITLE>Blog Post content type definition typo in documentation &quot;BloPost&quot;?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/guides/implement-fulltext-search/#optional-search-templates-customization Here we can see the Blog Post content type definition. We have now a section for every content type to define which part of this content item should be indexed as part of the FullText. By default content items will index the &quot;display text&quot; and &quot;body part&quot; but we also added an option for you to customize the values that you would like to index as part of this FullText index field. By clicking on the &quot;Use custom full-text&quot; we allow you to set any Liquid script to do so. So as the example states you could add {{ Model.Content.BloPost.Subtitle.Text }} if you would like to also find this content item by it's Subtitle field. For the remaining, we let you imagine what you could possibly do with this Liquid field : index identifiers, fixed text or numeric values and else! {{ Model.Content.BloPost.Subtitle.Text }} should be {{ Model.Content.BlogPost.Subtitle.Text }}</DESCRIPTION>
