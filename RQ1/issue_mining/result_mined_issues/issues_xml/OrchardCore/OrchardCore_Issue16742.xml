  <TITLE>Fix Duration shape to support RTL languages</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>In [DateTimeShapes](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/blob/main/src/OrchardCore/OrchardCore.DisplayManagement/Shapes/DateTimeShapes.cs#L118) We can't concatenate localized strings because RTL and other languages might not accept this order. Localized strings should be a single string with arguments. However with durations we need multiple variables to define the plurals, which we can't do (too many combinations), so we need to choose a form that will work in all cases. Suggestions, with the example of 2 days and 3 minutes. 1. 2 different strings When it's not a single unit: &quot;approximately 2 days&quot; and for single units: &quot;2 days&quot; 2. Only use the biggest unit: &quot;2 days&quot; We will ignore the smaller parts of the duration.</DESCRIPTION>
