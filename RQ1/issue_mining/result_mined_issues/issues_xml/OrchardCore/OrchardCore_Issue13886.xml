  <TITLE>Add a way to search contents with fields other than just displayText</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. Currently, when searching for contents we search the `DisplayText` property. In many case, I want to search content items for other fields like stock number or serial number. Currently, the only way to do this is by adding any info we want to search to the title. This may be acceptable is some case, but not all case. ### Describe the solution you'd like I would like to be able somehow search other properties. One way to do this is implement a new proper that isn't visible where we can use to search. Now sure what other ideas do we have to solve this challenge? @sebastienros I would like to talk about this during Steering committee meeting.</DESCRIPTION>
