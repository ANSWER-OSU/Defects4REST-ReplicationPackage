  <TITLE>Documentation Bug Maybe - Custom Theme Docs need a note about tenant enabling</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>This is in regards to #3346 and #5476 If you make a custom theme and want to use it in a tenant as part of a recipe you must enable it. The reason why this is not understood is because most people including myself made a custom theme project and then referenced it in our main web app. Because we referenced it I am going to guess it did not need to be &quot;enabled&quot;. This is why nobody saw a problem when they ran their recipe in non tenant mode. The problem only materializes when you try to run the same recipe as a tenant.</DESCRIPTION>
