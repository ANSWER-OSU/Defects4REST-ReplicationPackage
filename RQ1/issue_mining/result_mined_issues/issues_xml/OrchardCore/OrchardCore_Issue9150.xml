  <TITLE>Search Broken?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I upgraded one of my Orchard Core websites to a recent development release a couple of days ago and search stopped working. In particular it looks like the templates for `Search-Form.liquid` and `Search-Results.liquid` are no longer being rendered, but I haven't had time to investigate it deeply. I also noticed that I am getting errors in the backend when I attempt to add or edit a Lucene Index, but I'm not worried about that at the moment. Interestingly enough, when I run OrchardCore.CMS.Web (.NET5) from the source code using The Blog Theme and navigate to ~/search, it displays nothing (although I can add and edit indexes). I believe this used to display the search form and search results. I verified the search index and permissions are properly configured, but the route just doesn't display the search form or search results. Reproduce I start with no App_Data folder. 1. Navigate to src/OrchardCore.Cms.Web 2. `dotnet run -f net5.0` 3. Setup using The Blog Theme and Sqlite 4. Navigate browser to &quot;search&quot; and see nothing is displayed I don't see anything in the documentation that says search is any different. Am I missing something simple? Thanks!</DESCRIPTION>
