  <TITLE>Unnecessary placement rules in OrchardCore.Contents</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Currently in OrchardCore.Contents module there is a placement rule in placements. json as so : ``` &quot;Content_PublishButton&quot;: [ { &quot;place&quot;: &quot;Actions:5&quot; // Same as in the driver } ], ``` Apart from that the placement is already set from the driver this prevents other modules to add there own placement rule for this shape unless they take a dependency on this module. Also there is a placement rule : ``` &quot;Content_SaveButton&quot;: [ { &quot;place&quot;: &quot;Actions:6&quot; // Move the save button after the publish } ], ``` that is not used anywhere as there is no shape with this name. I propose to remove these 2 rules.</DESCRIPTION>
