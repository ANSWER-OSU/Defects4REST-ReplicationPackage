  <TITLE>Refine the admin menu</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>@Piedone, during the Admin Menu refactoring, you mentioned placing &quot;Features&quot; under &quot;Settings&quot;—and that thought still lingers with me! :) After gathering more feedback post-rollout, I’d like to propose a small refinement to further improve the admin menu’s usability. Currently, the **Tools** section includes some tools that are settings-related but function as tools rather than just configuration forms. To address this, I suggest adding a **&quot;Management&quot;** subcategory under **Settings** to house these settings-related tools. The updated structure would be: - **Settings** → **Management** → Features - **Settings** → **Management** → URL Rewriting Additionally, the **&quot;OpenID Connect&quot;** should be moved out of the **&quot;Security&quot;** submenu under Settings for better visibility and alignment. Instead of: - **Settings** → **Security** → **OpenID Connect** → Authentication Client - **Settings** → **Security** → **OpenID Connect** → Authentication Server - **Settings** → **Security** → **OpenID Connect** → Token Validation It would be: - **Settings** → **OpenID Connect** → Authentication Client - **Settings** → **OpenID Connect** → Authentication Server - **Settings** → **OpenID Connect** → Token Validation @gvkries, since you were part of the original discussions, I’d love to hear your thoughts on this!</DESCRIPTION>
