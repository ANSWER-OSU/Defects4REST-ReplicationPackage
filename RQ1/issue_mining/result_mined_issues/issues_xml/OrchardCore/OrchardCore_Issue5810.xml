  <TITLE>Workflow Timer Event creates X amount of &quot;HALTED&quot; workflows</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I have created a Timer Event in a workflow that is only supposed to run once a day at 00:00 using CRON: `0 0 * * *` https://crontab.guru/every-night However, at every minute when the background task runs, it creates a new HALTED workflow for this workflow type. After a couple of hours i had a lot.. So in order to test it out, I tried creating another Timer Event with CRON: `*/5 * * * *` to make it easier to see what would happen. https://crontab.guru/every-5-minutes Result: This will create a HALTED workflow every minute. Then, on the fifth event firing, it will create a new workflow as before but then execute all five at the same time. So either i'm doing something completely wrong or the cron/event task is seriously bugged?</DESCRIPTION>
