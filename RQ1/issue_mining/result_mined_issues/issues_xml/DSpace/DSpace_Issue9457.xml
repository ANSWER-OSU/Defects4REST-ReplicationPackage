  <TITLE>NotifyServiceRestRepositoryIT has two tests which do not succeed in GitHub CI</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** The `NotifyServiceRestRepositoryIT` has two tests which are consistently failing in GitHub CI. * `NotifyServiceInboundPatternConstraintRemoveOperationTest` * `NotifyServiceInboundPatternConstraintRemoveOperationBadRequestTest` However, these tests are *always* succeeding for me when I run them locally. My suspicion is that they are failing in GitHub CI because the tests are running in a different order and encountering _unexpected_ data. This most often occurs when other tests are not sufficiently cleaning up their own data. (It's also worth noting that the order of tests sometimes *does change* in GitHub CI...I suspect that has occurred recently, causing these tests to fail consistently.) I've attempted to resolve these failures twice: * #9444 (merged as it seemed successful at the time. But the failures have appeared again.) * #9456 (closed without merging. This might be worth referencing to see what fixes I attempted, but I was unable to get the tests to succeed.) **These tests have been temporarily disabled in #9458** They will require more investigation before they can be reenabled.</DESCRIPTION>
