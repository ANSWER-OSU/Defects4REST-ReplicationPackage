  <TITLE>[DS-37] Submission Forms don't preserve order of values - ID: 2541285</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;i&gt;Imported from JIRA &lt;a href=&quot;https://jira.lyrasis.org/browse/DS-37&quot;&gt;[DS-37]&lt;/a&gt; created by kipkorir2008&lt;/i&gt; &lt;p&gt;This bug occurs in 1.5.x XMLUI and JSPUI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Essentially the Describe (metadata entry) page of the submission process&lt;br/&gt; doesn't preserve the order that values are entered in multi-valued fields.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is especially problematic for Author names. During a submission&lt;br/&gt; author names are reordered such that the &lt;b&gt;first&lt;/b&gt; author listed is that&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;last&lt;/b&gt; one that you enter during the submission process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This patch modifies the org.dspace.submit.step.DescribeStep class (the&lt;br/&gt; processing class) in the dspace-api module, so that it will preserve the&lt;br/&gt; order in which values are entered. This way the &lt;b&gt;first&lt;/b&gt; author listed will&lt;br/&gt; always be the &lt;b&gt;first&lt;/b&gt; author entered, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This patch works for both the XMLUI and JSPUI since both of these&lt;br/&gt; interfaces utilize this same backend prorcessing class to save all values&lt;br/&gt; entered during the Describe step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This patch was built off the latest code in the dspace-1_5_x branch of SVN&lt;br/&gt; (as of 2009-Jan-27).&lt;/p&gt;</DESCRIPTION>
