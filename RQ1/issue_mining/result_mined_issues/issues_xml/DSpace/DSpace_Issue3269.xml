  <TITLE>Improve ServiceManager BeanException Logging</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** When the DSpace Service Manager fails to find a bean for any reason, details are not logged by default, making problems difficult to track down. A good example is that reported in https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues/3163 , where @mspalti was able to see the cause of a problem only by temporarily adding a `System.out.println` line in the `DSpaceServiceManager` code. Instead of this, failures to find beans should be logged in the DSpace log so the cause can be tracked down more easily. **Expected behavior** In these situations, a log of at least at WARN level should appear in the DSpace log, with details.</DESCRIPTION>
