  <TITLE>Enable all MetadataExportSearchIT tests (which were disabled in 7.3)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** Follow-up work to #8037. In #8037, we found that the integration tests added in [`MetadataExportSearchIT`](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/main/dspace-api/src/test/java/org/dspace/app/bulkedit/MetadataExportSearchIT.java) reliably _succeeded_ when run locally, but always _failed_ when run in our GitHub CI environment. We were unable to find a way to solve the consistent failures in GitHub CI, but decided to move this feature forward with the ITs disabled (especially since the ITs succeeded for all developers locally). This ticket is a reminder that we **must** find a way to enable these ITs &amp; determine the cause of the failures in GitHub CI. It likely is an environment-specific issue, but it's unclear if that environment-specific issue is in the main code or in the ITs themselves.</DESCRIPTION>
