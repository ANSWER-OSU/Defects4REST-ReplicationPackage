  <TITLE>[DS-516] DSRUN does not start Service Manager</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;i&gt;Imported from JIRA &lt;a href=&quot;https://jira.lyrasis.org/browse/DS-516&quot;&gt;[DS-516]&lt;/a&gt; created by mdiggory&lt;/i&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'll also comment you'll want to use the &quot;dspace&quot; CLI script to launch executions rather than &quot;dsrun&quot; as the DSpace services framework need to be started properly before updates happen to services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Comment to the developers... We rather missed this in our architecture of the new execution environment. We may want to consider removing dsrun or enabling a Main wrapper around it similar to the &quot;dspace&quot; shell runner so that the Spring/Services framework is properly started. An alternative would be to make &quot;dspace&quot; more flexible to support passing Classnames directly to it in the same manner as &quot;dsrun&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</DESCRIPTION>
