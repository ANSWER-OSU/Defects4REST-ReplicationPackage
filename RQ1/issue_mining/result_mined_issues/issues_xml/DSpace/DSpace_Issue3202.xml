  <TITLE>Collection location is not indexed for in submission items</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** When [searching for an in submission item](https://github.com/DSpace/RestContract/blob/main/search-endpoint.md#workflow), the attached collection of the item is not indexed, and not attached as a location of the record in solr This has the side effect that, when searching using the workflow configuration of discovery, that: * The item CAN searchable when using a general search * The item CAN NOT be found using the collection as a scope parameter The underlying reason for this is that, when the item is indexed, the [related collections](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/main/dspace-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/discovery/indexobject/ItemIndexFactoryImpl.java#L677) are checked But in progress items do not have a link to the owning collection -&gt; The [InProgressSubmission does have a link to the collection](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/main/dspace-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/content/InProgressSubmission.java#L42) **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Create an in submission item in a particular collection 2. Search that it's present in a 'general, non scoped' search for the workflow items 2.1 This item should be retrieved since it's indexed through [this indexer](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/main/dspace-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/discovery/indexobject/InprogressSubmissionIndexFactoryImpl.java#L49) 3. Search that it's present in a 'scoped' search, using the collection that the item is being submitted into 3.1 This item can not be found, since it doesn't contain location information for the collection **Expected behavior** Both the scoped and non scoped searches should return the relevant item</DESCRIPTION>
