  <TITLE>Bibtex import does not parse multiple authors into different fields</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Description** In the DSpace 7 demo area I wanted to import a Bibtex file from the MyDSpace area. However, the authors were not parsed separately, but as one big block. **Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Get a bibtex file with multiple authors 2. Go to MyDSpace 3. Select the bibtex file to import 4. Check the author field on the new item submission **Expected behavior** Multiple authors to be parsed into different fields **Example Bibtex** @article{Moreno-ParedesSantiago2021Fpae, author = {Moreno-Paredes, Santiago and Rodriguez-Alcala, Laura and Martin-Lagos Martinez, Juan and Muller Locatelli, Nicolas and Vazquez Lopez, Cristina and Vargas Fernandez, Jose Luis and Cabrera Peea, Alvaro}, address = {England}, copyright = {COPYRIGHT 2021 BioMed Central Ltd.}, issn = {1471-2377}, journal = {BMC neurology}, keywords = {Adult ; Cardiovascular agents ; Case studies ; Complications and side effects ; Embolism - chemically induced ; Embolization ; Embolization, Therapeutic - adverse effects ; Embolization, Therapeutic - methods ; Endovascular Procedures - adverse effects ; Endovascular Procedures - methods ; Ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer ; Facial Palsy ; Facial Paralysis - etiology ; Female ; Head and Neck Neoplasms - therapy ; Humans ; Magnetic Resonance Imaging ; Neck paraganglioma ; Paraganglioma - therapy ; Paralysis, Facial ; Polyvinyls - adverse effects ; Squid 12 ; Therapeutic embolization}, language = {eng}, number = {1}, pages = {45-4}, publisher = {BioMed Central Ltd}, title = {Facial palsy after embolization with Squid® 12}, volume = {21}, year = {2021}, }</DESCRIPTION>
