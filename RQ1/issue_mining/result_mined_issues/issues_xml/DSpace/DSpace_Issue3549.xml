  <TITLE>[DS-174] LDAP_Support for hierarchical LDAP servers</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;i&gt;Imported from JIRA &lt;a href=&quot;https://jira.lyrasis.org/browse/DS-174&quot;&gt;[DS-174]&lt;/a&gt; created by kipkorir2008&lt;/i&gt; &lt;p&gt;The LDAP support currently in DSpace only supports a flat authentication structure. Many institutions use a hierarchical strcture which is slightly more complex. There is a patch on the queue that addresses this, but also tries to do a few other things so this needs teasing out. Robin from Edinburgh has also written a patch for this. Stuart Lewis will volunteer to look into this. Some LDAP-enabled applications also allow the setting of multiple LDAP servers with different settings. Is this a requirement for DSpace?&lt;/p&gt;</DESCRIPTION>
