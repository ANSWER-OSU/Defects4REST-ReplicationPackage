  <TITLE>Facet entries in the discover/facets/{facet} endpoint does not return the authority key</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** When calling the {dspace.url}/api/discover/facets/{facet} endpoint, the results won't include the authority key, even though it should be there. **To Reproduce** 1. Set up a discovery core that has authority values for facets in the config 2. Try to retrieve the values through the call above 3. The resulting facet entries won't include the authority key **Expected behavior** The authority keys should be present in the response **Related work** This was discovered due to the failing tests in this PR: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/3176</DESCRIPTION>
