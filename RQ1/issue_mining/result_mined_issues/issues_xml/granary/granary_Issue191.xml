  <TITLE>Meetup.com: Modify error message when RSVPing to non-Meetup event</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>As per https://matrix.to/#/!goyPJLbDdnCsVhbPvo:matrix.org/$15821256645028zziDx:matrix.org &gt; (btw, we can improve the &quot;no in-reply-to found&quot; error msg when the in-reply-to exists but isn't a meetup event - eg plug https://snarfed.org/rsvp.html into https://brid.gy/meetup/7199313 - but that's minor)</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Fix: Return better error when RSVPing to non Meetup event However, the difficulty here is that this error is also returned in cases where the `in-reply-to` is not set, so we need this error message to cover both cases. Closes #191.</MESSAGE>
