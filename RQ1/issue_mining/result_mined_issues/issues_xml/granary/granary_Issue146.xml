  <TITLE>JSON Feed of Instagram posts should include the images inline</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>It seems that prior to your fix for #120, images were duplicated in some of the output formats. As part of the fix you special-cased Atom so that the image would still be included within the entry’s `&lt;content&gt;`. I think that JSON Feed should be getting the same treatment. I subscribed to an Instagram-via-Granary JSON Feed in Feedbin and while it shows the photos in the article list, the photos don’t actually appear in the content of the article. (In ReadKit for macOS and Reeder for iOS, which use Feedbin as a backend, the photo doesn’t appear anywhere at all.) The [JSON Feed spec](https://jsonfeed.org/version/1) also implies that featured images should be included in the `content_html` in addition to being listed in the `image` property.</DESCRIPTION>
