  <TITLE>Tray area icons won't disappear</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Describe the bug On the Windows system, after closing LocalSend, the tray icon is still displayed there, and the mouse pointer will disappear only when it is swept over it, otherwise it will always exist. Although this problem does not affect the use, you need to move the mouse pointer to the tray area every time you close LocalSend, and if you forget to do this, a row of LocalSend icons will appear in the tray area after many times ### To reproduce every time ### Expected behavior After closing the program, the LocalSend icon in the tray area will not disappear automatically ### Screenshots ![新标签页 - 用户1 - 53-045](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48204825/224467640-8a1e2e7e-ffb7-4912-ac8b-f72537f9ceed.png) ### Desktop (please complete the following information) _No response_ ### Smartphone (please complete the following information) _No response_ ### Additional context _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
