  <TITLE>Get 100 points on Google tools (and other performance tools)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>There are just some minor changes. We're much faster than competitors. We're almost here (almost 100 of 100) =)) 1. https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights 2. https://gtmetrix.com/ Right now our internal demo site (4.20) gets 99/100 for mobile and 100/100 for desktop. Several recommendations: 1. Combine images using CSS sprites. For example, /Themes/DefaultClean/Content/images/ajax-loader-small.gif and /Themes/DefaultClean/Content/images/compare-button.png 2. Defer parsing of JavaScript. Actually it's jQuery library that cannot be moved to the footer - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2644 3. Use cookie-free domains. For example, /Themes/DefaultClean/Content/images/logo.png or /thumbs/0000077_banner_1.jpg or ...min.css). Let's see whether we can (should) fix them. For example, 1. It's better not to implement point 1 in open-source solution as it'll make customization more complex for third-party developers 2. TODO 3. It can be &quot;fixed&quot; by moving static content to a separate domain (e.g. Azure BLOB) but it's not part of the default solution So the question is what should we fix? Everything is already done (for &quot;out of the box&quot; solution)</DESCRIPTION>
