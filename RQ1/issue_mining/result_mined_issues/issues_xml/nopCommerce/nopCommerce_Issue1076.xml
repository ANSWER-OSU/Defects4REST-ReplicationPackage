  <TITLE>USPS not responding causes site error</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>My site is erroring out right now, becuase the post office is erroring when the rate calculator is being called. this should rarely happen, but it would be nice if the user is given a useful error message about it. right now it's just a &quot;an error occurred&quot; screen</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>#1791 Changed the way how plugin views are stored. Now we store them in \Views\file.cshtml. Previously it was \Views\plugin_name_directory\file.cshtml (removed extra directory). It's much simpler.</MESSAGE>
