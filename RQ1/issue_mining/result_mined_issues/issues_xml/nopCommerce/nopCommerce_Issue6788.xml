  <TITLE>Rename &quot;Downloadable product&quot; hint</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Some merchants upload large files (e.g. 50+ MB) to database as downloadable products. In this case a nopCommerce store becomes slow or the appropriate product details page (in admin area) cannot be loaded. Obviously, that such large files should be upload to some FTP or file sharing hosting. And then merchants should use the &quot;Use download URL&quot; functionality instead of uploading it to the database. Considering that we do not support such large files (for storing in our database) it's better to rename the hint of the &quot;Downloadable product&quot; to &quot;Check if the product is downloadable. When customers purchase a downloadable product, they can download it direct from your store. The link will be visible after checkout. Please note that it's recommended to use 'Use download URL' feature for large files&quot;</DESCRIPTION>
