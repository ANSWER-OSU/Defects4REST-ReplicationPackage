  <TITLE>Add an option to display MiniProfiler only to store owners</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Can you please make the MiniProfiler to be visible only for store administrators? Very often we request our customers to enable the MiniProfiler in order to investigate a problem and they can't do that as it will be visible by all of their customers (especially when the site is live). This is a really small change but will be very handy for plugin vendors when investigating an issue.
