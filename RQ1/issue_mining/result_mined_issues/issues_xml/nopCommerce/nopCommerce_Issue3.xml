  <TITLE>Separate delivery addresses support</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>A store owner already can create several shipments per order. The next task is to allow customers to specify several shipping addresses during checkout. For example, product1 (qty 2) goes to address1 and product2 and product3 (qty 1 and qty3) goes to address2 Important notes: 1. But we'll create a new separate order for each specified address (like it's done in magento) because payment methods do not allow specifying several shipping addresses. It should also compute separate shipping totals or allow specifying distinct shipping methods for each delivery address! This option should be configurable (disabled by default). 2. We also should not store payment information in [Order] table/entity because in this case a payment could be &quot;shared&quot; between orders. For example, we could have 1 payment for several orders (as per point 1). First we should create a new [Payment] table/entity and move all information from [Order] table/entity there. Think about better way of managing it in admin area 3. Tax should be calculated separately for each address</DESCRIPTION>
