  <TITLE>&quot;Continue shopping&quot; button issue with the search page</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We found something interesting which maybe a bug- To reproduce, go to the demo site (http://demo.nopcommerce.com/). Search 'app' and press enter. At the search page, click the MacBook. On the product page, put the MacBook to the cart. If it was successful, please go to the cart. On the cart page, there is a button &quot;Continue shopping&quot;. If you clicked this button, the user will be redirected to an empty search result page (http://demo.nopcommerce.com/search). In many cases it works fine, but in several situation (we don't know when) it works as I described. We think that it is a bug, and we would like to know how to fix or workaround this.</DESCRIPTION>
