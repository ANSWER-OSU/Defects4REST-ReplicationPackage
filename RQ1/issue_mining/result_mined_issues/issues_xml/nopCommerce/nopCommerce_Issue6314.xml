  <TITLE>Sitemap ignores store mappings for languages</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.50.2 &gt; We activated &quot;SEO friendly URLs with multiple languages enabled&quot; at /Admin/Setting/GeneralCommon to have /en / fr in our domain for 2 different languages. &gt; &gt; It works ok and robots txt too. But the sitemap is including all existing languages, in this case 5, instead of the 2 assign to that store. &gt; &gt; So we should have 2 urls for each product but we have 5. &gt; the 3 language that should not appear in sitemap are limited to other stores.
