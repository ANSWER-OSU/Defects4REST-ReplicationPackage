  <TITLE>Invalid case of image URLs in BBEditor</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: develop Steps to reproduce the problem: &gt;With Forums enabled on the Linux OS I am using, which has a case-sensitive folder naming syntax, there is a case error when the software is resourcing an image. &gt;On my Linux/Debian OS, the software installed a folder using caps (/BBEditor), but the BBCode editor images are using reference links to folders expecting them to have no caps (/bbeditor), which renders broken images for B I U etc. while posting a topic as well as with private messages. `&lt;img class=&quot;button&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost/js/BBEditor/images/link.gif&quot; title=&quot;Link&quot; name=&quot;btnLink&quot; onclick=&quot;doURL('Text')&quot;&gt;` &gt;... should be ... `&lt;img class=&quot;button&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost/js/bbeditor/images/link.gif&quot; title=&quot;Link&quot; name=&quot;btnLink&quot; onclick=&quot;doURL('Text')&quot;&gt;` Source: https://www.nopcommerce.com/en/boards/topic/95146/case-sensitive-syntax-error</DESCRIPTION>
