  <TITLE>Checkout as Guest Or Register</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.1 Steps to reproduce the problem: 1. I have enabled anonymous checkout and I have disabled registration. 2. When a user chooses to checkout they are redirected to /login/checkoutasguest. 3. The issue is the &quot;Register&quot; button and copy stating the advantages of registering are present even though the user will not be allowed to register. IMO for this scenario it is best to not even show the checkoutasguest page and just redirect to the cart. 1. Typically if someone disables registration there are not returning users. 2. There is no point in asking them if they want to register because that will fail. 3. This leaves checkout as guest as the only option.</DESCRIPTION>
