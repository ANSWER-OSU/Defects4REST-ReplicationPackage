  <TITLE>Page not found in &quot;Preview&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Multi-store (steps to reproduce): 1. We have store1 and store2 2. Admin (a vendor) uses &quot;Store1&quot; 3. He (she) creates a product limited to store2 4. Click &quot;Preview&quot; 5. Page is not found the same applies to ACL Source: http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/38848/nopcommerce-380-roadmap-and-estimated-release-date-lets-discuss.aspx?p=24#171246 But if we implement it for a store owner, then it can confuse him if he can view products in other stores. I think we should add some kind of &quot;preview&quot; query string and use it. So when specified and the current user has &quot;edit product permission&quot;, then we should not validate multi-store or ACL (or unpublished, etc). Let's decide it first</DESCRIPTION>
