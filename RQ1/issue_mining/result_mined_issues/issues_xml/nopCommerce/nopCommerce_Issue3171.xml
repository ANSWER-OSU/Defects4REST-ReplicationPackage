  <TITLE>Invalid column name 'PictureBinary' when importing from excel into Products</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.10 Beta Steps to reproduce the problem: Export a selection of products and make a few changes. Import that excel back into Nop using the import feature. Found issue in the PictureService class GetPictureHash(int[] pictureIds) method. The SQL string references PictureBinary, but that looks like it was dropped and moved to it's own table.</DESCRIPTION>
