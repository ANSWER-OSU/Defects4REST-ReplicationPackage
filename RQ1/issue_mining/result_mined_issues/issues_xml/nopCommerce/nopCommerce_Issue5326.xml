  <TITLE>MFA in a closed store</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.40 develop Steps to reproduce the problem: &gt; I've just configured two-step authentication, using Google Authentication. My store is currently closed, and after filling in the user &amp; password, I got directed to the &quot;storeclosed&quot; page before I can fill in the required authentication code from the app. Source: [https://www.nopcommerce.com/en/boards/topic/90187/two-step-authentication-closed-store](https://www.nopcommerce.com/en/boards/topic/90187/two-step-authentication-closed-store)</DESCRIPTION>
