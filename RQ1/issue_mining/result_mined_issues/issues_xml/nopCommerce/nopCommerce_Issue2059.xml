  <TITLE>Return Requests list. Include product attribute details</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>It would be very helpful if the Return Requests list and return request edit pages included not only the product name, but also the variant/attribute combination of the product which is being returned. For example, we might have a customer buy size small/left and size small/right and only return size small/right. I can imagine how my staff will become confused about which item is to be returned and then ship same incorrect product to customer again.
