  <TITLE>SQL Update Script - [StorePickupPoint]</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I'm running NopCommerce 3.90 in production and when I run the 4.00 upgrade script in on my Localhost I get the below error: Msg 208, Level 16, State 1, Line 671 Invalid object name 'StorePickupPoint'. Msg 4902, Level 16, State 1, Line 676 Cannot find the object &quot;StorePickupPoint&quot; because it does not exist or you do not have permissions. UPDATE [StorePickupPoint] SET [DisplayOrder] = 0 WHERE [DisplayOrder] IS NULL GO I looked in both PROD and LOCALHOST and neither locations have that table. So I downloaded a new version of 3.90 and installed it on my localhost and it DID install the [StorePickupPoint] table. So not sure where my 3.90 missed it and where the new 3.90 installed it. But maybe a check and install it if its not there?</DESCRIPTION>
