  <TITLE>Add Reply-To for Order Notification Email</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.50 &gt; When I receive an order, sometimes I want to reply to the customer directly from the order notification email. Rather than copy and paste the customers email address from the body of the email, it would be easier to click Reply and the customers email address is already in the To field. Source: https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/topic/93657/add-reply-to-for-order-notification-email We could add a new property to `MessageTemplate` whether to fill in `ReplyTo` with a customer (or admin) email if applicable. We already have `ReplyTo` parameters in `SendNotification` method, so we should pass them when this new property is set for the particular message template.</DESCRIPTION>
