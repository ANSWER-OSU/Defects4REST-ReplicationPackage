  <TITLE>Do not store &quot;clean&quot; passwords for external authentication systems</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We've found a problem with Facebook External Authentication. If somebody use it to login in the store, nopCommerce will create explicit password, which is a combination of numbers. We think it should be done in a safer way. For example, encrypted like a normal password.
