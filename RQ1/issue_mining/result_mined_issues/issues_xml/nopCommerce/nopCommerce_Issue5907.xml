  <TITLE>Estimate shipping not applying on the shopping cart page</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&gt; I have found a bug in the Cart page where after selecting a shipping method it's not updating in the order summary section &gt; &gt; 1. nopCommerce version: 4.40.4 &gt; &gt; 2. Expected behavior: After selecting a shipping method order summary should show the selected &gt; shipping method and prices should adjust accordingly if applicable &gt; &gt; 3. Actual behavior: Order Summary not updating after selecting shipping method &gt; &gt; 4. Steps to reproduce the problem: Go to cart page after you have added products , then click on estimate shipping and select a shipping method &gt; &gt; 5. Any private modifications : No &gt; &gt; Reasons for the problem : &gt; An Invalid url parameter is being sent as a &quot;$&quot; sign is placed in the requested url . &gt; &gt; &gt; Solution : &gt; Remove `$` sign from the the following cshtml =&gt; [src/Presentation/Nop.Web/Views/Shared/Components/ShoppingCartEstimateShipping/Default.cshtml](https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/blob/develop/src/Presentation/Nop.Web/Views/Shared/Components/ShoppingCartEstimateShipping/Default.cshtml#L57) &gt; where a ajax request is being sent to the following route &quot;shoppingcart/selectshippingoption&quot; Source: https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/topic/92236/cart-page-estimate-shipping-not-applying-bug</DESCRIPTION>
