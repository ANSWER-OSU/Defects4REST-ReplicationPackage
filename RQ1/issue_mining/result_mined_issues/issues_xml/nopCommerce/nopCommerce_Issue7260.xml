  <TITLE>Negative `ProductCategory.DisplayOrder` is set to 0</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.70.4 + Steps to reproduce the problem: 1. Edit a category that contains products 2. In the &quot;products&quot; section at the bottom of the page edit a product to set it's display order 3. Set the value to a negative number 4. Update the product 5. Negative Value is not stored and value is set to 0 ## Notes Using the network tab in your browsers dev-tools reveals that the negative number is transmitted to c#, but the model inside `CategoryController.ProductUpdate` already only contains 0. I could not find any code or action filter that introduce this behavior, so that we would be able to overwrite this functionality for our customers. This previously worked in nopCommerce 4.60.x ## Expected behavior Negative values should be store correctly. ## Additional notes Our customer relies on this feature heavily, as this increases his capability of sorting products as he likes without the need to change all other products assigned to this category. Other `DisplayOrders` are unaffected by this change. The display order of the category itself can be changed to a negative value. The same goes for manufacturer. This seems to only happens where the display order is can be changed inside a table. This can in example also be seen for the display order of payment methods</DESCRIPTION>
