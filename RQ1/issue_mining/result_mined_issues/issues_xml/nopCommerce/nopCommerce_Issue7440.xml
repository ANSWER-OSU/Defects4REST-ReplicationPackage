  <TITLE>Avoid using services during installation of nopCommerce</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Most services depend on the DB in one way or another, so we can't use them in the standard way. Instead, we must resolve them via context, which is not a good practice. It will be safer to get rid of using services by duplicating part of the code, as we have already done with the ValidateSeNameAsync method.</DESCRIPTION>
