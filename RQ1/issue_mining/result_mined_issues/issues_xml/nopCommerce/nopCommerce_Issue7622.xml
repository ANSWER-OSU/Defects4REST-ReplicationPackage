  <TITLE>MemoryCacheManager produces an issue if the eviction callback happens after the item is re-added to the cache</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Sometimes, the OnEviction method callback occurs after the key has been re-added to the cache, which leads to the desynchronization of the cache state and the internal key manager. Details are described in [this post](https://www.nopcommerce.com/en/boards/topic/101937/settings-cache-issue-in-4748)</DESCRIPTION>
