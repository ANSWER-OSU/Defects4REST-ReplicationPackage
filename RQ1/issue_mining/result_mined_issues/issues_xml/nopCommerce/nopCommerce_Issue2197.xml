  <TITLE>Make more methods public in factories</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>First of all let me say that the the extraction of the code from the controllers into the factories is a great step forward for all nopCommerce vendors as now we don't need to inherit from the various controllers if we want to reuse some logic. But there are some methods that previously were available in the controllers and we have used them in many of our plugins but now these methods are not part of the factory interfaces and could not be used and we still need to inherit from the actual factories, which could be prevented. Could you make these methods to be part of the interface? - PrepareSortingOptions, PrepareViewModes, PreparePageSizeOptions, PrepareCategorySimpleModels from CatalogModelFactory - PrepareProductSpecificationModel from ProductModelFactory Source: http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/46341/nopcommerce-390-beta-released-please-share-your-impressions.aspx?p=7#184397</DESCRIPTION>
