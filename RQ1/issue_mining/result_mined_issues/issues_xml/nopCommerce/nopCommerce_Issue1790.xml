  <TITLE>Publish Inserted, Changed and Deleted Events for OrderItems for Fulfillment</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>For fulfilling orders via third parties, it would be convenient if events regarding inserted, changed and deleted to OrderItems were published individually. Currently, the only way to do this properly is with custom checks. I have never tried a pull request and I am a crappy coder, but I could try to tackle this.
