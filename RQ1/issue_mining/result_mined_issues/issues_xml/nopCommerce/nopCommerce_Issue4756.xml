  <TITLE>Bug of weight format in non US language with Nop.Plugin.Shipping.UPS</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.30 (last version of develop branch) Steps to reproduce the problem: Hi! I found a bug with UPS plugin when I proceed to checkout: I use two languages in my NopCommerce installation =&gt; English and French When I use english language everything works great with UPS plugin. When I use french language, I get this error: **Error while getting UPS rates One or more errors occurred. (An exception has been raised as a result of client data. Hard error: Missing or invalid package weight for package 1.)** What happened? I debug the code and I found the unique difference in datas between the two languages. In the object &quot;UPSRate.RateRequest&quot; =&gt; Shipment =&gt; Packages =&gt; One of them [0] =&gt; PackageWeight.Weight the value is different and I think that the UPS API does not support commas. Here is the format of my weight in english: - 64.285714285714285714285714286 And here is the format of my weight in french: - 64,285714285714285714285714286</DESCRIPTION>
