  <TITLE>Sales Summary Report - incorrect profit calculation</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.60 &gt; with new installation with sample data, create a product with product cost. &gt; checkout the new product. &gt; view the sales summary report group by day. The profit and order total are the same when the profit should be lesser than order total. &gt; &gt; The problem happens when there are multiple orders in a day, the profit calculation is done by selecting the top 1 order of that day.
