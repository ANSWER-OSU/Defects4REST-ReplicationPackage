  <TITLE>Add a message that the user is already logged in when he opens the login page again</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.20, 4.30 Steps to reproduce the problem: - Log in to store, - Open the login url again in the same store. - It will ask you to log in again. If you open the store at login url, even if you logged in it will ask you to logged in, In version 4.2 it keeps refresh the login page without any error message but makes you believe that you cannot login, while the truth is that you already logged in. In version 4.3 will ask you to logged in again, and then sometimes it's stuck in login page and sometimes redirect you to home. Conclusion: What I believe is that if user logged in and he opens login url next time by mistakes, it should be redirect to Home or perhaps account page, to avoid such misunderstanding. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57217759/106896118-d3215900-66f9-11eb-9f1e-99b011b4f1c8.png)</DESCRIPTION>
