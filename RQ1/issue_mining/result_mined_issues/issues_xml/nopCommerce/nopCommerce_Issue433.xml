  <TITLE>Bundles of downloadable products don't work</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Right now we simply disabled this option (display a warning) Forum source: https://www.nopcommerce.com/en/boards/topic/27409/downloadable-product-associated-with-other-downloadable-products 1. Note that we should also allow a store owner to activate/deactivate downloads in admin area &gt; order details pag for such orders. How can we do it easily for bundled products? 2. We should also include &quot;download&quot; link into message templates. How can we do easily it for bundled products? maybe, it's just better it's simply ignore such downloadable products. Just add an appropriate note to the &quot;Associate product to product attribute&quot; page also see https://www.nopcommerce.com/en/boards/topic/44494/suggestion-option-to-upload-file-to-each-product-attribute also see https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/2564</DESCRIPTION>
