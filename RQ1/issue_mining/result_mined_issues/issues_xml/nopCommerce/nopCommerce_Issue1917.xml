  <TITLE>Reward points should not include shipping fees (make it configurable)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Looks like reward points include shipping costs on total . Anyway to disable this ? Since shipping costs vary on my products that I sell and are on the high side I do not want to include in reward points total. Is this something that's going to need custom work ? Reward points are normally given for goods purchased, not associated services. But let's make it configurable (include shipping during upgrade). This way it won't affect totals of existing stores after upgrade Source: http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/45244/reward-points.aspx also see https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/53</DESCRIPTION>
