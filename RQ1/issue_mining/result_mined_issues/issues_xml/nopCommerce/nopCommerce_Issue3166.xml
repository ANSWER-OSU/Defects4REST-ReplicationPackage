  <TITLE>4.10 BETA - Feature Request</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.10 BETA You may consider adding a comment to the web.config file above this line. ` &lt;aspNetCore requestTimeout=&quot;23:00:00&quot; processPath=&quot;%LAUNCHER_PATH%&quot; arguments=&quot;%LAUNCHER_ARGS%&quot; ....` When deploying to Windows 2016 Server on Azure, change the auto-generated processPath=&quot;dotnet&quot; to processPath=&quot;C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe&quot; to make it work. If you don't do this, the user will get this message: ``` HTTP Error 502.5 - Process Failure Common causes of this issue: The application process failed to start The application process started but then stopped The application process started but failed to listen on the configured port Troubleshooting steps: Check the system event log for error messages Enable logging the application process' stdout messages Attach a debugger to the application process and inspect For more information visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=808681 ``` Note when running the app on the server directly from the command line, the cli doesn't use the web.config so the app will run. Driving you crazy to figure out. I went through 2 other hosting companies who didn't figure that out before I found the answer. Hope this helps.</DESCRIPTION>
