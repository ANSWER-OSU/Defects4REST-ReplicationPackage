  <TITLE>An email sent to a vendor should not be in the customer language</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>There are several emails sent to vendors. For example, when an order is placed or paid for. However in that case it uses the language of a customer. One more certain example, OrderProcessingService class invokes _workflowMessageService.SendOrderPlacedVendorNotification(order, vendor, order.CustomerLanguageId); We could do it the following way. Add a new extension method to &quot;Vendor&quot; entity (then we can use this method to load vendor language). First, it'll load an associated customer record. And then load its language by &quot;Language ID&quot; (like it's done in other classes). If language is not found, then load default language. If not found, then load the first found one. But... a vendor could have multiple customer records associated. Load the first found customer? We could add &quot;LanguageId&quot; property to &quot;Vendor&quot; record. But it'll just make solution much more complex Let's discuss and choose a better approach first Maybe, just use a default store language?
