  <TITLE>Optimized section structure in &quot;pickup-points-form&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>inside the Pickup Points area on shipping address page (at checkout), &lt;div class=&quot;pickup-points&quot; id=&quot;pickup-points-form&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; you have implemented all content to have the &quot;section&quot; class name - it's been added to the &quot;pickup point&quot; element, to the Google map, and to the &quot;message-error&quot; element. But when the &quot;section&quot; class name was implemented during the last refactoring of nopCommerce, it wasn't meant to be applied to all kind of elements but rather to some bigger wrapping elements, so global css can be applied through it. Since the pickup point element, the map, and their error message are semantically of the same section, it will be much better if you remove this class from the children elements and add it to the common parent, like this: &lt;div class=&quot;section pickup-points&quot; id=&quot;pickup-points-form&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; Source: http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/43433/suggestion-optimized-section-structure-in-pickup-points-form.aspx</DESCRIPTION>
