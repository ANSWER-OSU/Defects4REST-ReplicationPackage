  <TITLE>Double click at confirm button during checkout</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Not sure whether anyone notice that, when accidentally click twice at the confirm button, it will direct you to a empty cart screen, but I was expecting a payment screen. This may be a minor bug, but might affect the user experience.
