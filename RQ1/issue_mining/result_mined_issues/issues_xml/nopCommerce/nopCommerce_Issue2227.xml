  <TITLE>Add better instructions for users using external authentication and getting &quot;email already exists&quot; error</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Registered customers or customers who removed the external record and wishes to login with facebook, the system returns an message: &quot;email already exists&quot; and block the login. But actually they can associate with an existing account. First, they have to login using email and password (internal). Then, try to login using Facebook. So we just have to create a better intructions (not just &quot;email already exists&quot;). For example, tell them that if they want to associate an existing customer account with Facebook record, then they should be logged in Source: http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/46601/login-logic-problem.aspx</DESCRIPTION>
