  <TITLE>Export-Import issue for deleted manufacturer/category mapping</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.5 Steps to reproduce the problem: 1. Create a Manufacturer 2. Assign it with Product (new row insert on Product_Manufacturer_Mapping) 3. Delete the Manufacturer 4. Still the mapping is present but the Manufacturer is deleted 5. Export and then Import, it will show the ERROR (Sequence contains no element............) I think it will do the same thing for Deleted Categories If you need any kind of help to regenerate the issue you can contact with me (atiqur.foyshal@brainstation-23.com)</DESCRIPTION>
