  <TITLE>&quot;Require other products added to the cart&quot;. Do not allow to remove required products from the cart</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The cart contents page displays the &quot;Remove&quot; check box for the required item which if the user checks will remove the required product from the cart. The page then reports (in red) that a required item has to be added. The required item should not be allowed to be removed from the cart contents by the customer if there is at least qty 1 of the main product in the cart. This should be the correct and intuitive behavior.
