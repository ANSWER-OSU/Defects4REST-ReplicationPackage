  <TITLE>Issue with &quot;SEO friendly URLs with multiple languages&quot; and non-existing codes in URLs</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I've noticed google indexing my page with country codes in URL eg. http://nopcommercestore.com/uk/product-name I've looked around and found that I can also use other country codes in URL http://nopcommercestore.com/gr/product-name http://nopcommercestore.com/nl/product-name At first I thought I have some strange codes set for languages but I don't have &quot;gr&quot; or &quot;uk&quot; on my list of languages. Forum source: http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/22468/country-codes-in-url.aspx Fix: 1. Open \Nop.Web.Framework\Localization\LocalizedUrlExtenstions.cs 2. Find &quot;IsLocalizedUrl&quot; 3. Validate located language (whether it exists) here Just ensure that it won't affect performance much</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>#725 Issue with &quot;SEO friendly URLs with multiple languages&quot; setting fixed. Previously non-existing language codes could be specified in URLs by users. For example, you had only English and Russian languages but users could visit URLs such as http://www.yourstore.com/gr/product-name (Greek).</MESSAGE>
