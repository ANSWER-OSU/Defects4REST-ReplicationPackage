  <TITLE>&quot;Show product images on cart&quot; setting is used instead of &quot;Show product images on wishlist&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We found bug at whishlist. From admin panel, there are two settings: Show product images on cart Show product images on wishlist But to disable images on wishlist, you need to disable also at the cart. If you disable images at the cart, and check to show images on wishlist only, it would not be shown. source: http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/46119/wishlist-images.aspx</DESCRIPTION>
