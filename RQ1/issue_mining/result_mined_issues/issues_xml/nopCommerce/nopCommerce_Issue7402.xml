  <TITLE>“From” price not updating correctly with product attribute overrides</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.70.4 and 4.70.5 Steps to reproduce the problem: In the product detail page (and in the category view), when there are prices set in the Product Attribute’s “Override” field, the “From” price is not being recognized if discounts are applied afterward. Additionally, if a price is defined in the product card’s “Price” field, the system consistently pulls the initial value instead of dynamically updating based on selected attributes. When selecting different attributes with override prices, the “From” price should ideally reflect the override prices defined for each attribute. However, this functionality does not work as expected for products with attributes. This leads to incorrect pricing display, causing user confusion on products with multiple attribute options.</DESCRIPTION>
