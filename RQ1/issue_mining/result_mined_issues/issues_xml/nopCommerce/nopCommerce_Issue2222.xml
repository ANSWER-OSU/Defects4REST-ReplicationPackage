  <TITLE>Do not authenticate users in impersonation mode</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>When you’re on the impersonate mode, and changing the email address of the impersonated person, nop ends the impersonation mode and logs you in as that person. I see that in the customer controller when the email address is changed, nop calls the authentication service and sign in the person with the new email address. I added a condition there to consider if the user is being impersonated, to ignore that.</DESCRIPTION>
