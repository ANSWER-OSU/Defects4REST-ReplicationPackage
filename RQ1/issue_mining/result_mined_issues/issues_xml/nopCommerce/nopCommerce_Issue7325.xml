  <TITLE>Allow to enable lock for order placement</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>In some cases if could be helpful to allow a store owner to enable a lock when placing an order (&quot;performwithlock&quot;). For example. by executing a single packet attack, wherein multiple purchase requests are sent simultaneously the last bytes of said requests are held back and sent with a single packet. The server then processes the requests in parallel and a race condition occurs. Let's allo to enable it. But with some conditions such as: 1. Only for the same customer or 2. For orders that redeem the same gift cards (in order to avoid duplicated redeems) But allow a store owner to disable it because in some cases it could lead to deadlocks. And this lock (setting) will be disabled by default P.S. Contact Andrei to get a detailed list of steps to reproduce the issue.</DESCRIPTION>
