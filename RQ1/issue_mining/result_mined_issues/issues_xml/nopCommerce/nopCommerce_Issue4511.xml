  <TITLE>New widget zone in AdminHeaderLinks</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.30 This isn't an issue, but a suggestion. Could you add a Widget area in the AdminHeaderLinks? I have a few plugins I'd like to link directly to them. Right now I just edit the file, but maybe other people may like to add links there with their plugins.</DESCRIPTION>
