  <TITLE>[FEATURE] Android Signer Certificate Status: v1-scheme-only should not be marked as &quot;good&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>If you're requesting a new feature/enhancement, explain why you'd like it to be added and it's importance. **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** According to [New Android vulnerability allows attackers to modify apps without affecting their signatures](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/blog/new-android-vulnerability-allows-attackers-modify-apps-without-affecting-their-signatures), it is highly recommended to &quot;[...] at least always apply signature scheme v2.&quot;. Unfortunately, the current version of MobSF does not distinguish qualitatively between [the four different signing versions](https://source.android.com/security/apksigning). **Describe the solution you'd like** MobSF should not use &quot;good&quot; as status for the Android Signer Certificate if a APK was signed using the v1 scheme only. **Describe alternatives you've considered** n/a **Additional context** n/a</DESCRIPTION>
