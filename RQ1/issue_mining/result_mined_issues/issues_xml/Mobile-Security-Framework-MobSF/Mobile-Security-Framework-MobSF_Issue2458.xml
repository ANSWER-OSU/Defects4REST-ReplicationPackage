  <TITLE>Old Package Versions Causing Build Failures on NixOS</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- ## IMPORTANT --&gt; &lt;!-- Issues are ONLY for reporting BUGS. For support, feature requests, questions, queries, and discussions use our slack channel for limited support. Join MobSF Slack channel: https://join.slack.com/t/mobsf/shared_invite/zt-2umjnqlsm-sNSh9g4GFraPUBPqatwTxw --&gt; &lt;!-- If you see errors while running setup/run scripts, it is mostly because you haven't installed the required dependencies correctly. You will have to look into the errors and figure out what is causing them and solve them accordingly. Make sure you have installed all the required dependencies and their correct versions as per the latest documentation. If you still find yourself at a dead end, join MobSF Slack channel:https://join.slack.com/t/mobsf/shared_invite/zt-2umjnqlsm-sNSh9g4GFraPUBPqatwTxw Please do not post support/help request in GitHub issues, doing so will definitely waste our time get them closed without further response. --&gt; ## ENVIRONMENT ``` OS and Version: NixOS 24.11 Python Version: Python 3.12 MobSF Version: 4.1.3 ``` ## EXPLANATION OF THE ISSUE &lt;!-- If you see errors while running setup/run scripts, join MobSF Slack channel: https://join.slack.com/t/mobsf/shared_invite/zt-2umjnqlsm-sNSh9g4GFraPUBPqatwTxw to get limited support. --&gt; First, apologies if this does not quite qualify as a bug, it is an edge case in my view. I was trying to package this for NixOS, as the docker is not ideal for the way nix is setup. In the pyproject.toml while most of the packages are set to a range, a few of the packages are pinned to specific versions that are causing issues. Specifically: &gt; openstep-parser = &quot;1.5.4&quot; &gt; packaging = &quot;&gt;=21.3,&lt;22.0&quot; and to a much lesser extent &gt; bcrypt = &quot;4.0.1&quot; For openstep-parser, this is a really old version of this package, and there does no appear to be any api changes, so I can't tell if there is a real reason it is pinned to this. It is old enough that it uses some dependencies that are past the depreciation period, and therefore will no longer build at all on nix. And for a reason I can't determine, packaging version 21.3 will not build either. If there is a reason bcrypt is pinned, unlike the other two I can work around it, so it is not a major issue. More of a minor inconvenience than anything else. I was wondering if these could be updated to a newer version (every version after those builds still), or have their version ranges opened up by &gt;= to allow for the packaging build issues to be resolved. &lt;!-- BEFORE POSTING YOUR ISSUE/BUG - These comments won't show up when you submit the issue. - GitHub issues ARE NOT FOR FEATURE REQUESTS, SUPPORT, DISCUSSIONS AND QUESTIONS! - If you have questions, use our slack channel. Join MobSF Slack channel: https://bit.ly/3mCMNOx - Reproduce issue in the latest master and try to add as much detail as possible. - Search this repository (top of the page) for the issue and it has not been fixed or reported already. - Once you open a bug, you should also provide additional information if requested. - Failure to do so in 25 days will result in closure of the bug without further communication. --&gt;</DESCRIPTION>
