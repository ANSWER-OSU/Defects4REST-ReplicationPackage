  <TITLE>[FEATURE] Problem with android permission</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>If you're requesting a new feature/enhancement, explain why you'd like it to be added and it's importance. **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** When i have the permission : com.oppo.launcher.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS in my manifest it give me the permission description of : android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS so &quot;Allows an application to modify the system's settings data. Malicious applications can corrupt your system's configuration.&quot; but it should have as description &quot;Unknown permission from android reference&quot; **Describe the solution you'd like** In manifest_analysis.py line 146 in the for loop don't rfind the last word but take all the permission name . And in dvm_permissions.py write the full name permission **Describe alternatives you've considered** if the permission doesn't have android.permission in it tag as unknown **Additional context** If tomorrow i create a malware with a custom permission like : com.mymalware.SET_ALARM it will be tag as a normal permissions and not a dangerous one.</DESCRIPTION>
