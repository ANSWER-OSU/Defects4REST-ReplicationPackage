  <TITLE>Not possible to add new monitors to editing status page</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### ⚠️ Please verify that this bug has NOT been raised before. - [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue ### ️ Security Policy - [X] I agree to have read this project [Security Policy](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/policy) ### Description Hi guys, I have created some monitor and then I have created a status page. I could be able to add monitors created to status page successfully. However, I have added some additional monitors. Therefore, I wanted to add those new monitors to the status page. So I click edit status page button, but I couldn't be able to add the new monitors. ### Reproduction steps - Add X monitors - Create a status page - Add monitors available to status page - Save changes - After create X additional monitors. - Then, come back to status page previously created and click to edit status page button. - No monitors available. Add one (this message is showed). Despite that I created new monitors. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13409704/168828290-5507cf8c-5f75-4b00-b2d9-e3cf2b8c1e64.png) ### Expected behavior Be able to add additional monitors to status page to editing. There is a workaround that consists to create again the status page. But is not very productive. ### Actual Behavior Is not possible to add new monitors (previously created to editing status page) ### Uptime-Kuma Version 1.15.1 ### Operating System and Arch Mac OS big Sur ### Browser Chrome Versión 85.0.4183.83 (Build oficial) (64 bits) ### Docker Version 20.10.6 ### NodeJS Version _No response_ ### Relevant log output _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
