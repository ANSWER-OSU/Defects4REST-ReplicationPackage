  <TITLE>monitor type ping stopped working</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Info** Uptime Kuma Version: 1.3.2 Using Docker?: Yes OS: Windows (client) Docker with uptime-kuma runs on Debian 10 Browser: Chrome I installed uptime-kuma a few days ago and setup a few monitors, most of them https and one as ping type. The ping type one stopped working yesterday evening. I know the target is up, even if I do a `docker exec -ti uptime-kuma sh ` and do a manual ping to the same target the ping works so why does it keep failing for a full 24h inside uptime-kuma? Also, uptimerobot reports no issues pinging this particular host. Open for any suggestions.</DESCRIPTION>
