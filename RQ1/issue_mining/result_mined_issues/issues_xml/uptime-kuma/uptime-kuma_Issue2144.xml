  <TITLE>Octopush Notifier not working - simple fix?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### ⚠️ Please verify that this bug has NOT been raised before. - [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue ### ️ Security Policy - [X] I agree to have read this project [Security Policy](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/policy) ### Description When attempting to create a new Octopush notification, even when using correct identifiers, the testing fails with a generic notification. ![Screen Shot 2022-09-30 at 7 32 57 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1290033/193325282-5973e0ce-4786-458d-b9a2-b04297bf5c50.png) [Looking at the server-side code](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/master/server/notification-providers/octopush.js) This is not due to an incorrect configuration, but rather notification.octopushVersion being set to something other than 1 or 2. I don't know Vue well enough to figure out if [this front-end code is correct or not](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/master/src/components/notifications/Octopush.vue) ### Reproduction steps On a new Uptime-Kuma instance, create a new Notification using Octopush. API Version: Either API Key: Any string &quot;Login&quot; Any string SMS Type: Either Telephone: Any numbers Then click the &quot;Test&quot; button -&gt; Get error. ### Expected behavior Expected Octopush to send or give a failure of credentials, etc. ### Actual Behavior Generic message about incorrect Octopush version. ### Uptime-Kuma Version 1.18.0 ### Operating System and Arch Mac OS Monterey 12.6 ### Browser Brave ### Docker Version _No response_ ### NodeJS Version 16 ### Relevant log output ```shell uptime-kuma_1 | Error: Error: Error: Unknown Octopush version! uptime-kuma_1 | at Octopush.throwGeneralAxiosError (/app/server/notification-providers/notification-provider.js:38:15) uptime-kuma_1 | at Octopush.send (/app/server/notification-providers/octopush.js:59:18) uptime-kuma_1 | at Function.send (/app/server/notification.js:116:57) uptime-kuma_1 | at Socket.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/app/server/server.js:1149:46) uptime-kuma_1 | at Socket.emit (node:events:527:28) uptime-kuma_1 | at Socket.emitUntyped (/app/node_modules/socket.io/dist/typed-events.js:69:22) uptime-kuma_1 | at /app/node_modules/socket.io/dist/socket.js:466:39 uptime-kuma_1 | at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:78:11) ```</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Fixed Octopush Notifier not working #2144 The version number was passed as a string from the frontend but was checked against a number in the backend provider. This caused the if else if to fall through into an error. The literal it is now being compared has been changed to a string and the unknown version error is no longer encountered.
