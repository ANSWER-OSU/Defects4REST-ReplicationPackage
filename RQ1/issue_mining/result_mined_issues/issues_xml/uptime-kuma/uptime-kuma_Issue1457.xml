  <TITLE>Feature: Make it extremly easy to add multiple monitors fast</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### ⚠️ Please verify that this feature request has NOT been suggested before. - [X] I checked and didn't find similar feature request ### ️ Feature Request Type UI Feature ### Feature description While the interface is amazingly nice it's still a big task to add 5, 10, 50 monitors. Make it easy. ### ✔️ Solution # The simple I suggest to make an option to add multiple montors in a row. Consider this: you have a list of monitors prepared in your notepad, exported from another system or whatever. Now consider you * copy all 50 lines of hostnames, * click on add multiple, insert the 50 hostnames in a textarea and * then choose monitor type for all * click create all Now you have 50 monitors. A few needs adjustments, most dont # The one with extra &quot;ommph&quot; Expand the format to allow for specifying a few key options directly in the copy paste. Key is keeping it simple and not go nuts on how much to specify: ping:hostname http://hostname http://hostname, keyword tcp:hostname dns:hostname ### ❓ Alternatives Api - but this is diffferent. It's easy for onboarding and you get ppl to see the full potential ### Additional Context _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
