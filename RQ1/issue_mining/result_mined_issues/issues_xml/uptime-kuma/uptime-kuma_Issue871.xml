  <TITLE>[Bug] Telegram Bot Token displayed in notification setup view</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### ⚠️ Please verify that this bug has NOT been raised before. - [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue ### ️ Security Policy - [X] I agree to have read this project [Security Policy](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/policy) ### Description While setting up the Telegram notification, there's the &quot;updateURL&quot; displayed at the bottom. It should help users finding their userID - but since Telegram puts the token right in the URL, you are displaying a secret again. Related to #268. ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5798157/140061776-7c2fe861-e608-47f1-8af0-ffbb155dd9b6.png) The piece of code that's responsible for this: https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/6944b35ea74edbd703f2c5a867bbdf1981f3b452/src/components/notifications/Telegram.vue#L23-L35 Since the bug report form required me to read the security policy: I do not think that this an actual &quot;security issue&quot; as in a vulnerability. ### Reproduction steps 1. Open a monitor 2. Click on Edit 3. Setup Notification ### Expected behavior The full URL is not shown (or shown masked) to the user. That way other viewers (screen share or real life meeting) can't copy the bot token. ### Actual Behavior In the setup view the token is shown within the URL. ### Uptime-Kuma Version 1.10.0 ### Operating System and Arch Debian 5.10.46-4 (2021-08-03) x86_64 ### Browser Firefox 93.0 (64-Bit) ### Docker Version 20.10.10, build b485636 ### NodeJS Version N/A ### Relevant log output ```shell N/A ```</DESCRIPTION>
