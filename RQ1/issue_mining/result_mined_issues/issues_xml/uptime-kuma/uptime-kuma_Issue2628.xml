      <MESSAGE>Perform sanity check on uptime for status page Fixes #2628 A sanity check is performed when calculating the uptime of a monitor on status page. If it is greater than 100%, we just show 100%. This hasn't been implemented on the dashboard at the request of @louislam due to concerns it would make debugging more difficult in future if changes were made to the uptime calculation.
