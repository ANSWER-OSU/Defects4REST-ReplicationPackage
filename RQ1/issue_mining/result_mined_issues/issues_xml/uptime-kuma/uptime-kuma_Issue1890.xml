  <TITLE>Certificate Expiry Notification doesn't work for me... any ideas?</TITLE>

UP/DOWN alerts arrive fine. Test notification is OK too. Certificate Expiry Notification is set for all configured monitors. Settings -- Notifications -- TLS Expiry default to 7 &amp; 14 &amp; 21 days On the monitor's dashboard Cert Exp. determined correctly. But no mention of expiry in the log either. What do I do wrong here? Appreciate any help.
