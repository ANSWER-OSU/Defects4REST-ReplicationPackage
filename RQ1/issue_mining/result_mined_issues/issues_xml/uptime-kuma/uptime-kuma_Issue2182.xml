      <MESSAGE>Added #2182 Add support for custom radius ports This commit adds support for the port to be specified when using the radius monitor type. A check has been implemented to ensure that a null value is not passed to the radius check function as could occur with monitors that were created before this change was introduced. The default port of 1812 is displayed when the user selects the radius monitor in much the same way as the DNS port is handled. The port was not included in the hostname in the form hostname:port in order to avoid issues with IPv6 addresses and monitors that had been created before this change was implemented.
