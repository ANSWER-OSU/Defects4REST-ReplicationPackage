  <TITLE>Adding Elestio as deployment option</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### I have found these related issues/pull requests Related to #5110 ### ️ Feature Request Type Other ### Feature description Hey team, I am Kaiwalya, Developer Advocate at Elestio. Elestio has been providing options of fully deploying and managing Uptime Kuma application as shown [here](https://elest.io/open-source/uptime-kuma). I think it would be a great idea if we can add it to official readme/documentation here. In addition to this, if you are interested we provide partnership opportunities with tools we support by **revenue share** upon addition of this method in docs. If you would like to collaborate, just shoot me an email at [kaiwalya@elest.io](mailto:kaiwalya@elest.io) :) ### ✔️ Solution Adding the one-click deployment button to the readme. ### ❓ Alternatives _No response_ ### Additional Context _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
