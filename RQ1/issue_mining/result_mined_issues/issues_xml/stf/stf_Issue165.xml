  <TITLE>running stf local</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I have installed docker and pulled the image from the docker hub. Now i am confused what to do next? Do i need to install all the requirements explicitly on my ubuntu machine including rethinkdb ? I have also tried to ref. to the solution given by you but you have mentioned there to see the deployment file, which makes me confused to understand difference between stf local and actual deployment. Can you please help me.</DESCRIPTION>
