  <TITLE>Refactor HCD Agents</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The Agents for HCD have been under some fluctuation lately due to Converged Cassandra changes. Currently, HCD 1.1 is based on CC 4, while HCD 1.2 is based on CC 5. However, HCD 1.2 will soon switch back to CC 4. All of the underlying CC versions and changes create compilation and runtime issues for the Agent, which is why we have different Agents for Cassandra 4.0, 4.1 and 5.0, as well as DSE 6.8 and DSE 6.9. Since HCD 1.1 and 1.2 are now going to be CC 4 based, it might be better to refactor the HCD agent modules in this project to reflect the CC version as opposed to the HCD version. ┆Issue is synchronized with this [Jira Story](https://datastax.jira.com/browse/MAPI-104) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io) ┆Issue Number: MAPI-104</DESCRIPTION>
