  <TITLE>MCAC bump to 0.3.6</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Since we cannot just drop MCAC #619 , because the k8ssandra-operator needs to stop using it first (after which we probably need some grace period). Until then, we still need to patch the snakeYaml CVEs by bringing in MCAC that has a newever version of that library. ┆Issue is synchronized with this [Jira Story](https://datastax.jira.com/browse/MAPI-112) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io) ┆Issue Number: MAPI-112</DESCRIPTION>
