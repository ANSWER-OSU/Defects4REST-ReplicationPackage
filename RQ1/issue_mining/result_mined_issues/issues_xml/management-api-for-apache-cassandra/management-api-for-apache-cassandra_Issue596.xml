  <TITLE>Add symlink to /tmp/dse.sock for DSE images</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Some downstream projects are using the cassandra socket created by the Agent, and for DSE images, are expecting `/tmp/dse.sock` to be available for cqlsh connections. As of version v0.1.80, that socket creation was changed to `/tmp/cassandra.sock` for uniformity. To aleviate issues downstream, a symlink should be created in the DSE images that links `/tmp/dse.sock` to `/tmp/cassandra.sock` ┆Issue is synchronized with this [Jira Story](https://datastax.jira.com/browse/MAPI-98) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io) ┆Issue Number: MAPI-98</DESCRIPTION>
