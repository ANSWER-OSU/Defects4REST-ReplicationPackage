  <TITLE>Improve version management</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue: The Management API version of releases has been controlled by an automated process that triggers on a tag being pushed. The release process publishes artifacts to Cloudsmith.io where the Maven version is overridden on the command line used to publish the artifacts. It is never actually set in the Maven pom.xml files to anything other than `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`. In addition to publishing artifacts in Cloudsmith.io, the jarfiles are also zipped up and attached to a GitHub release. However, the zip bundle contains the jarfiles with a version that is still `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`, making it very difficult to determine which version of the artifact you are using. ### Definition of Done * [ ] The release process should update the version in the POM files so that it keeps up with the current version ┆Issue is synchronized with this [Jira Story](https://datastax.jira.com/browse/MAPI-14) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io) ┆Issue Number: MAPI-14</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>Improve version management (#595) This patch adds version information to the manifest of each artifact. It also updates the startup log in the Agents to log the release version instead of &quot;v0.1&quot; so the logs indicate more accurately which version is running.</MESSAGE>
