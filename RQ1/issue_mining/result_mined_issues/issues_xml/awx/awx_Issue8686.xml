  <TITLE>AWX Project module should allow forcing update</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Feature Idea ##### SUMMARY We need to have ability to force project update in our tower using where we are using infrastructure as code. I am aware of the fact that we have `project_update` but Sean and I talked and he has initial code https://github.com/ansible/awx/compare/devel...sean-m-sullivan:project_update here. Opening this issue to add visibility. Adding this enhancement will make https://github.com/redhat-cop/tower_configuration/tree/devel/roles/tower_role more useful for us(my team) as regular Tower Infra-as-Code (IaC) users. Thanks @sean-m-sullivan</DESCRIPTION>
