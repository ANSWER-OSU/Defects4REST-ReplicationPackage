  <TITLE>Warn louder if tower_job_launch extra_vars are not set to be accepted via ask_extra_vars</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### SUMMARY `extra_vars` on `tower_job_launch` needs `ask_extra_vars` to be set via the `tower_job_template` module when creating the JT (alternatively, you can set `PROMPT ON LAUNCH` in the Job Template page of the UI), otherwise the `extra_vars` do not get handled as intended (they are ignored). There should be a warning emitted that tells the user &quot;You have `extra_vars` on launch listed, however this Job Template does not have &quot;Prompt on Launch&quot; set to True&quot;, since some users may attempt to set `extra_vars` on launch and not see them get handled properly.</DESCRIPTION>
