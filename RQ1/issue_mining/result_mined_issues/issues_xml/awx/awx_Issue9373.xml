  <TITLE>[ui_next] Silent error when creating or editing an inventory source to 'Update on launch' and 'Update on project update'</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report ##### SUMMARY When creating or editing an inventory which is sourced from a project, if the 'Update on launch' and 'Update on project update' options are selected, the form does not save and the API's error response does not get displayed in the UI. ``` {&quot;update_on_launch&quot;:[&quot;Cannot update SCM-based inventory source on launch if set to update on project update. Instead, configure the corresponding source project to update on launch.&quot;]} ``` I think the fix for this should be two parts: 1. Update the tooltips for both toggles to note that they cannot be used simultaneously 2. Surface API errors to user on save, generally. ##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE 1. Create an Inventory with type 'Sourced from a Project' 2. Select both 'Update on launch' or 'Update on project update' 3. Save Note: error in console</DESCRIPTION>
