  <TITLE>Workflow job details shows erroneous fields</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Please confirm the following - [X] I agree to follow this project's [code of conduct](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html). - [X] I have checked the [current issues](https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues) for duplicates. - [X] I understand that AWX is open source software provided for free and that I might not receive a timely response. ### Summary &lt;img width=&quot;1673&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2022-04-05 at 1 14 58 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9889020/161813234-72a8c128-5996-4675-af78-dda234d86dba.png&quot;&gt; In this case, I did not specify a wf level inventory so I would expect that field to empty and not say `Deleted`. Also, workflows don't have a global project so I don't think we should be showing that field at all. ### AWX version latest ### Select the relevant components - [X] UI - [ ] API - [ ] Docs ### Installation method docker for mac ### Modifications no ### Ansible version _No response_ ### Operating system _No response_ ### Web browser _No response_ ### Steps to reproduce 1. Create a WFJT (only supply a name) 2. Launch the WFJT 3. Navigate over to the Details tab on the WF job ### Expected results Inventory shows empty string or not shown at all Project field should not be shown ### Actual results See screenshot in summary ### Additional information _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
