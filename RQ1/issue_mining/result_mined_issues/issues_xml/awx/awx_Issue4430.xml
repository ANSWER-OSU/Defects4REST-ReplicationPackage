  <TITLE>Add host details modal to output</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### SUMMARY More detail may be needed in this issue but I'm going to do my best to include what's needed/where to look for more information in the existing application. [Link to mockups](https://tower-mockups.testing.ansible.com/patternfly/jobs/jobs-output-host-modal/) To see the existing logic governing whether or not an event row is clickable reference [this bit of logic](https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/awx/ui/client/features/output/render.service.js#L266). When an event meets ^^ that criteria, the user should be able to click on the line and see the [host details modal](https://tower-mockups.testing.ansible.com/patternfly/jobs/jobs-output-host-modal/). The content of the modal varies based on certain conditions. JSON is always visible. The standard out/standard error are only shown when available. You can see that existing logic [here](https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/awx/ui/client/features/output/host-event/host-event-modal.partial.html#L41). Whether or not stdout/stderr are available is determined [here](https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/awx/ui/client/features/output/host-event/host-event.controller.js#L34). As far as I can tell, the content of the stdout/stderr tabs comes straight from the API. @jakemcdermott is that accurate? Here are links to the [stdout](https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/awx/ui/client/features/output/host-event/host-event-stdout.partial.html) and [stderr](https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/awx/ui/client/features/output/host-event/host-event-stderr.partial.html) detail partials. Note that we'll need the sparkline in this modal. That portion will be gated on #4225.</DESCRIPTION>
