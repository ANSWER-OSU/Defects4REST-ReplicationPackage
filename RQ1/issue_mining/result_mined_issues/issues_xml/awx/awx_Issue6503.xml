  <TITLE>All groups filter on groups list doesn't work for root groups (and display is bad)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>![Screen Shot 2020-03-31 at 11 01 02 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1342624/78041652-f5f71a00-733e-11ea-8138-c3f9011c006b.png) the current filter for root groups is parents__isnull = true. the all groups filter (parents__Isnull = false) is actually showing all _but_ root groups. we'll have to figure out another way to do that filter (possibly by just removing parents__isnull altogether. there is also a display issue...the actual value for the tag (true/false), rather than label text explaining what's going on for the tag is confusing.</DESCRIPTION>
