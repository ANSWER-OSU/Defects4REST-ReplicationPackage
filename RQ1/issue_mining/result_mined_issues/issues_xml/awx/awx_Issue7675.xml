  <TITLE>Add inventory kind and organization name as default search options on Inventory List</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Feature Idea ##### SUMMARY I think both of these would be really useful as defaults. 1) Inventory kind: This would be a boolean where the user could select Inventory or Smart Inventory to trim down the list to only inventories that match that kind. 2) Organization name: If we're going to do https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/7673 then I think giving users a quick way to search for it would be nice. The payload would look like `organization__name=WhateverTheSearchIs`</DESCRIPTION>
