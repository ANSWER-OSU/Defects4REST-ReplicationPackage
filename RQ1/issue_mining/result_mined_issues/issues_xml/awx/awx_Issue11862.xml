  <TITLE>Add help text popovers to /#/credentials details fields</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Feature Idea ##### SUMMARY Spawned out of https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/9215 See /#/settings for how this should work. If you look the details view for a particular settings group you'll see help text popovers next to many (if not all) of the fields. The help text matches up with the fields in the form. We want to bring all the forms/details to parity in this regard. If you see form fields that are missing help text, feel free to add it. I'm not going to list out all the possible fields across all the different credential types. Given that custom credential types are a thing, we'll need to do this dynamically.</DESCRIPTION>
