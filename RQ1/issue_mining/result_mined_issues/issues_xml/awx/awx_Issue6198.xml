  <TITLE>Question: add more AWX task instances to docker stack</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello Im having a question. After I have successfully deployed AWX on a machine with docker, i wanted to increase the amount of TASK instances for that AWX setup. I went to the compose folder, edited the docker-compose.yml and duplicated the &quot;task&quot; service. I gave the container and the service a different name, saved an restarted the stack. After login to AWX again I can see the additional task instance under instances, but its &quot;dead&quot;. ![awx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3270156/76032149-95adcc00-5f7c-11ea-875b-f8ffdd3e613e.JPG) Its not sending heartbeats, and if I disable the first instance, the second doesn't pick up tasks. Even if turn it off and on again, and it appears as online for a while, it doesnt work. I also have been running `/usr/bin/update-ca-trust` on the additional unit, but nothing changed. I could not really find any information on how to add an instance even after searching for hours now. Please help.</DESCRIPTION>
