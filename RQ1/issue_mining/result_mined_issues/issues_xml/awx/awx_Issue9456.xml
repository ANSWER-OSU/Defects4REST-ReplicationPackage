  <TITLE>Adding a User or Team to the Access tab of a Credential Can't be Saved</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report ##### SUMMARY When attempting to give access to a user or a team inside of a credential, the check boxes behave strangely and the Save button does nothing when clicked. ##### ENVIRONMENT * AWX version: Devel 3/2/2021 ##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE Click on Credentials. Click on a single credential and navigate to its access tab. Click Add, and select either User or Team. Click on the role permissions. Try to uncheck them. You'll notice that checking one role can uncheck another role. Try to click Save. You can't. ##### EXPECTED RESULTS A user should be able to give access to a user or a team within a specific credential. ##### ACTUAL RESULTS A user or team can never be given access to a credential because the Save button doesn't work. Also the check boxes of the different roles behave strangely. ##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ![Screen+Recording+2021-03-02+at+12 18 59+PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63685497/109688697-927afb00-7b52-11eb-94e5-88bfc33d9e35.gif)</DESCRIPTION>
