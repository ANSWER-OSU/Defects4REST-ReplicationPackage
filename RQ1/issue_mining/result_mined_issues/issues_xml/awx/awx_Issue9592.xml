  <TITLE>Unable to select non-global execution environments for organizations</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>If you have an execution environment that has organizations assigned to it, you can't choose that EE from the UI when assigning EEs to an organization. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a new EE a. Use `quay.io/ansible/awx-ee` for the image b. assign it to an organzation 2. Navigate to that organization's page 3. Try to assign that new EE to the organization. It won't show up in the list. I've verified that you can assign it via the API.</DESCRIPTION>
