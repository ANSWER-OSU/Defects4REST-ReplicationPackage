      <MESSAGE>Merge pull request #10185 from jakemcdermott/fix-10170 Drop the word 'name' from image field, add examples for #10170 We call this field &quot;Image&quot; in other places, so we want it to match. Also, &quot;Image name&quot; can be confusing because people may think they just need to provide the image name instead of the full image location, which includes registry and tag version. cc @gamuniz @nixocio @beeankha @tiagodread Reviewed-by: Kersom &lt;None&gt; Reviewed-by: Bianca Henderson &lt;beeankha@gmail.com&gt; Reviewed-by: Julen Landa Alustiza &lt;None&gt;</MESSAGE>
