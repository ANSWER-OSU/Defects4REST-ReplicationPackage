To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function. in WorkflowJobTemplateDetail (created by I18n) in I18n (created by WithI18n) in WithI18n (created by WorkflowJobTemplate) in Route (created by WorkflowJobTemplate) in Switch (created by WorkflowJobTemplate) in article (created by Card) in Card (created by WorkflowJobTemplate) in section (created by PageSection) in PageSection (created by WorkflowJobTemplate) in WorkflowJobTemplate (created by Context.Consumer) in withRouter(WorkflowJobTemplate) (created by I18n) in I18n (created by WithI18n) in WithI18n (created by Context.Consumer) ``` ##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE 1.
