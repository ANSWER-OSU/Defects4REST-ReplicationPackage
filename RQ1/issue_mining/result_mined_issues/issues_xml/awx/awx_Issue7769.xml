  <TITLE>Update conditional in project update playbook - require min Ansible 2.9 to install collections</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report ##### SUMMARY This needs to be backed off from 2.8 to 2.9: https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/708244881cc6cd04722d3bc36d7d6036bffc329a/awx/playbooks/project_update.yml#L165 Because if you run with Ansible 2.8, it gives blank `stdout` and that's confusing. If my research is correct, @jborean93 added the `ansible-galaxy collection` CLI in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/57106, which was 2.9. Version 2.8 seems to mistake these invocations for a role command, and it doesn't work right.</DESCRIPTION>
