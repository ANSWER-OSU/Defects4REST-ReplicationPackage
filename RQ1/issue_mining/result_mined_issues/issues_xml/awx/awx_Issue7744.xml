      <MESSAGE>Rebase (#3) * Correctly parse sumologic url paths - Sumologic includes a token with a '==' at the end of it's host path. This adds rsyslog conf parsing tests and does not escape equals signs. * allow org admins to remove labels * Fix misc. linter errors due to the flake8-3.8.1 release - [Ref] https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/release-notes/ * properly write rsyslog configuration as 0640 see: https://github.com/ansible/tower/issues/4383 * Bump foreman collection to 0.8.1 * New release includes: 'add host_filters and want_ansible_ssh_host like script used to have' * foreman: use group_prefix for all groups * awx's &quot;compatibility layer&quot; for the foreman plugin had the group_prefix hard-coded to 'foreman_' * delete and re-add host when ip address changes * The websocket backplane interconnect is done via ip address for Kubernetes and OpenShift. On init run_wsbroadcast reads all Instances from the DB and makes a decision to use the ip address or the hostname based, with preference given to the ip address if defined. For Kubernetes and OpenShift the nodes can load the Instance before the ip_address is set. This would cause the connection to be tried by hostname rather than ip address. This changeset ensures that an ip address set after an Instance record is created will be detected and used. * track stats by hostname not remote host/ip * broadcast websockets have stats tracked (i.e. connection status, number of messages total, messages per minute, etc). Previous to this change, stats were tracked by ip address, if it was defined on the instance, XOR hostname. This changeset tracks stats by hostname. * don't block on log aggregator socket.send() calls see: https://github.com/ansible/tower/issues/4391 * Send content-type with mattermost notifications, fixes #7264 * Make all_parents_must_converge settable when creating node When targeting, ../workflow_job_templates/id#/workflow_nodes/ endpoint, user could not set all_parents_must_converge to true. 3.7.1 backport for awx issue #7063 * disable reports option for foreman * Allow use of fallback instance_ids * update VMWARE_INSTANCE_ID_VAR * Favor instanceUuid * .. but fall back to instanceuuid if necessary * Add queue / instance group registration to heartbeat for k8s installs There is some history here. https://github.com/ansible/awx/pull/7190 &lt;- This PR was an attempt at fixing a bug notting ran into where some jobs on k8s installs would get stuck in Waiting forever. The PR mentioned above introduced a bug where there are no instance groups on a fresh k8s-based install. This is because this process currently happens in the launch scripts, before the database is up. With this patch, queue / instance group registration happens in the heartbeat, right after auto-registering the instance. * wrap --instance-id-var in quotes * revert EC2_INSTANCE_ID_VAR * UI translation strings for release_3.7.1 branch * fix a regression in how job host summaries are generated this change fixes a bug introduced in the optimization at https://github.com/ansible/awx/pull/7352 1. Create inventory with multiple hosts 2. Run a playbook with a limit to match only one host 3. Run job, verify that it only acts on the one host 4. Go to inventory host list and see that all the hosts have last_job updated to point to the job that only acted on one host. * [DO NOT PORT to AWX] Pin dev requirements (#4413) * add backwards support for ssl_verify in foreman * plugin changed option name from ssl_verify to validate_cert * UI translation strings for release_3.7.1 branch for es and nl * Added the ability, to set the broadcast_websocket_secret variable. This is nessesary if you would like to rerun the playbook. Signed-off-by: JoelKle &lt;34544090+JoelKle@users.noreply.github.com&gt; * Fixed a bug, where the redis.conf first would be stored with mod 0600 and in the next task changed to 0666. This has broke the ability to rerun the playbook. Signed-off-by: JoelKle &lt;34544090+JoelKle@users.noreply.github.com&gt; * Reintroduce label filtering Labels are visible if you have a role on the org they are in, or on a job template they're attached to. * use jinja2.sandbox for credential type injectors * Don't follow redirects in credential plugins * Reduce error detail in webhook notification * Reduce error detail in credential lookups * prevent unsafe jinja from being saved in the first place for cred types see: https://github.com/ansible/tower-security/issues/21 * add tests for clarified label permissions * Include instance_id in host edit request * fixed broken UI links * remove the usage of create_temporary_fifo from credential plugins this resolves an issue that causes an endless hang on with Cyberark AIM lookups when a certificate *and* key are specified the underlying issue here is that we can't rely on the underyling Python ssl implementation to *only* read from the fifo that stores the pem data *only once*; in reality, we need to just use *actual* tempfiles for stability purposes see: https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/6986 see: https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1880 * Upgrade community.vmware for better error surfacing * Change Dockerfile to copy custom venv * update the named URL code to properly return 404 vs 403 * Force worker processes to have a different signal handler from the parent Situations have come up where the 5+ minute kill signal for run_task_manager is emitted to the worker process running it, but since the worker improperly inherited the AWXConsumerBase().stop() handler a deadlock ultimately was triggered on the database connection. * properly report 30x errors on credential plugin tests * pin pytest-forked to fix broken unit tests * properly obfuscate connection errors for credential lookup failure * Cache downloaded roles &amp; collections Populate the cache the first time the job is run for a revision that needs them, and for future runs for that revision just copy it into the private directory. Delete the cache on project deletion. Invalidate the cache on a new project revision Also download roles/collections during the sync job Since we're writing into a per-revision cache, we can do this easily now. Don't try and install content if there aren't any requirements expecting it Adjust pathing to the proper location. Force install if doing a manual sync. Requirements may be unversioned. Remove the cache when delete-on-update is set Integrate content caching with existing task logic Revert the --force flags use the update id as metric for role caching Shift the movement of cache to job folder from rsync task to python Only install roles and collections if needed Deal with roles and collections for jobs without sync Skip local copy if roles or collections turned off update docs for content caching Design pivot - use empty cache dir to indicate lack of content Do not cache content if we did not install content Test changes to allay concerns about reliability of local_path Do not blow away cache for SCM inventory updates Remove project update vars no longer used Remove job pre-creation of content folders code style edit, always use cache_id as property in tasks Fix log message * Avoid using long name of option not in 2.8 * Use quotations when marking strings for translation * Add settings framework * Hide license route based on install and add useConfig hook * ARM image build support * upgrade `chromedriver` for ARM support * upgrade `pynacl` to fix `libsodium` build issue on ARM * remove unnecessary i686-specific `libstdc++.so.6` package * install `kubectl` and `tini` from upstream binaries for ARM support * use upstream `postgres` and `alpine` docker images for `postgresql` helm chart Fixes #7051 * Fix garbage being printed when exporting as YAML - related #7795 This resolves issue #7795, by passing the `encoding` keyword argument only when the code is run on a Python 2 interpreter. related #7795. * Adds delete functionality to user tokens list * Removes Inventory Script screens, routes, stubs etc. * remove vNNN from example migration files * Create marginally more realistic event data with firehose * Fix rbac on Add button on User Access/Team Roles lists * mark PRIMARY_GALAXY_USERNAME and PRIMARY_GALAXY_PASSWORD as deprecated * Handle form submission errors that may be deeply nested in the return object * Updated import/export names for consistency * Adding RuntimeError which is returned from a connection error in awx/main/dispatch/control.py * Fix isolated dev env * begin a 14.0.0 changelog * Bump version to 14.0.0 * Make 'inputs' idempotent in credentials module, add test to check this works * Add execution environment metadata to AWX collection * Remove showExpandCollapse prop from the DataListToolbar calls Remove showExpandCollapse prop from the DataListToolbar calls. This is not an expected prop to be passed to this component. Inside DataListToolbar. ``` const showExpandCollapse = onCompact &amp;&amp; onExpand; ``` In order to use this feature, `onCompact` and `onExpand` props should be passed. ... * Add advanced search to UI * Updates to support advanced search changes: - make set type and lookup prefixes/suffixes on searchColumns explicitly defined - send possible search keys from options requests on (most) lists * fix duplicate variable and key usng array index issues * Add AdvancedSearch propTypes and defaultProps * Move Search to hooks and excise PF Dropdown in favor of Select * fix merge conflicts and failing test * fix AddRersourceRole sort column * add selectors for cypress tests * add back in searchable keys props to user token list * make sortColumnKey error message more clear * update searchablekeys prop names for project lookup * make name default searchColumn for ProjectJobTemplatesList. also add helpful error message to tell you this is the issue * update rest of lookups to use correct searchableKeys props * delete inadverdently added back InventoryScriptLookup file * fix busted flake8 CI * Fix early return in assign related method This change fixes an erroneus early return in a private method that was preventing more than one type of related object from being correctly assigned to the parent object, and therefore imported. Also, a minor spelling mistake was corrected. * Export Workflow Job Template Node Labels This change adds related Labels to the Workflow Job Template document that is exported by the AWX CLI. Previously, exporting and then importing Workflow Job Templates would not retain their related Labels. * Update websockets.md Add documentation for websocket backplane secret key exchange logic. * Update websockets.md spelling * Add feature to add instance group Add feature to add instance group. See: https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/7744 * Refactor organization look to use useRequest hook * Add smart inventory add form and host filter lookup * Add smart inventory edit form * Decode host filter chip values and fix boolean search filter chip bug * Upgrade gitpython to pick up bug fix * Revert updater changes to Ansible requirements * Allow YAML as a CLI import format This changset allows the import of YAML formatted resources. The CLI user can indicate which format to use with the `-f, --format` option. The CLI help text has been amended to reflect the new feature. The AWX CLI `export` subcommand offers the option of formatting the output as YAML or JSON, so it makes sense that the `import` subcommand reflects this. A simple test is also provided. In order to ease the task of testing commands that import resources by reading the stdin, the CLI has been extended to allow specifying an alternative file descriptor for stdin, similarly to stdout and stderr. * update to a newer python-ldap to address a bug see: https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/7868 * minor cleanup up CLI import -f yaml support * Change regex to match what is in source * Add feature to edit instance group Add feature to edit instance group.
