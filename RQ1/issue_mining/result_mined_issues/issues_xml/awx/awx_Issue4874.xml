  <TITLE>Support object reference by (unique) name globally</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Feature Idea ##### SUMMARY &lt;!-- Briefly describe the problem or desired enhancement. --&gt; I would like to be able to refer to IDs of things by their unique names when possible, globally. It appears that some functions are able to use this, such as getting a credential: ``` $ /data/awx/virtualenv/bin/awx credential get omgjlk-via-vault -f human id name == ================ 18 omgjlk-via-vault ``` But if I try to use that when creating a credential input source I get an error ``` $ /data/awx/virtualenv/bin/awx credential_input_sources create --target_credential omgjlk-via-vault --input_field_name ssh_key_data --source_credential gtower-vault --metadata &quot;{'secret_key': 'ssh_key_data', 'secret_path': '/secret/apps/gtower-keys/omgjlk'}&quot; -f yaml source_credential: - Incorrect type. Expected pk value, received str. target_credential: - Incorrect type. Expected pk value, received str. ``` Allowing the name to be used in one place but not another is pretty annoying. Now I'll have to query the API to discover the ID of these things, parse the output, etc... If I could just use the names then I can rely on the data I already have _outside_ of AWX, the source of my config.</DESCRIPTION>
