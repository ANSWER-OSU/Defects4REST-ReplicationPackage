  <TITLE>How to enable CORS on awx-tower? Documentation needed.</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report ##### SUMMARY I would like to use the AWX API to run jobs from a custom front-end, however I am unable to get past the authentication surrounding it. If I provide credentials in the header, I get no response and if I don't provide any headers I get : {&quot;detail&quot;:&quot;Authentication credentials were not provided. To establish a login session, visit /api/login/.&quot;} Our AWX version was recently upgraded in order to have CORS enabled, however I am unable to find any documentation for how to set up CORS other than this feature request: https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/1519 I have tried installing django-cors-headers and added in setup.py : INSTALLED_APPS = ['corsheaders' ] MIDDLEWARE = [ 'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware', 'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware' ] CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True That caused all kinds of errors. I request any documentation regarding how to enable CORS so I can access the API through my front-end. ##### ENVIRONMENT * AWX version: 6.1.0 * AWX install method: docker on linux * Ansible version: 2.8.2 * Operating System: CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core) * Web Browser: firefox</DESCRIPTION>
