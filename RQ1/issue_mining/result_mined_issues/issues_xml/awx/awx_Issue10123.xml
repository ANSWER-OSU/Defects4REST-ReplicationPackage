      <MESSAGE>Merge pull request #10171 from jakemcdermott/remove-job-isolated-settings Remove all AWX_ISOLATED* fields I believe this should address #10123. The issue mentions a worker-json.js 404 and, while we should fix that at some point, I don't think it's actually related to the save not working. SUMMARY I noticed the job settings form wasn't saving on devel. After some debugging, I found that removing the AWX_ISOLATED_CHECK_INTERVAL and AWX_ISOLATED_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT made the form saveable again. It doesn't seem like we use any of the AWX_ISOLATED* fields anymore (not to be confused with AWX_ISOLATION* fields, which we do use) so this PR removes them all. cc @wenottingham @shanemcd @marshmalien @gamuniz @tiagodread @jbradberry Reviewed-by: Jeff Bradberry &lt;None&gt; Reviewed-by: Bill Nottingham &lt;None&gt; Reviewed-by: Tiago Góes &lt;tiago.goes2009@gmail.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
