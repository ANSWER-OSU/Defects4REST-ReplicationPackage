  <TITLE>Support for s390x</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### SUMMARY I wanted to start a discussion about supporting `s390x`. I ported a version of AWX a while back to `s390x`, and it went pretty smooth. There were just a couple small tweaks that needed to be made to get the Docker images to build. Here are a couple of tweaks that were needed (These are off the top of my head, more might be needed): - Template out the base image pulls, CentOS to ClefOS - Point the download for Tini to an updated version, I think v0.16.1 was the first build for `s390x` - Some lib C packages might need to be changed - IUS Repos will need to be changed/modified to alternative repo lists Would you guys be open to support `s390x`? I know a lot of the Dockerfiles are using templating to be dynamic. One possible solution would add a couple more dynamic parameters to allow for the changes that `s390x` needs. Thus, not changing the Dockerfiles for `x86` but still allowing `s390x` images to be built.</DESCRIPTION>
