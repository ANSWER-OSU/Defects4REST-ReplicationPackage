  <TITLE>[ui_next] SCM Inventory Source Update Details view has no link to the project Sync which caused it</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report - Enhancement ##### SUMMARY It is very common that the sync fails because the source_project_update fails, and having a link to it is absolutely critical for usability. It would also be nice to have a link to the inventory source &amp; the source project (as opposed to the source update). However, I guess we can get by without these. If we don’t have a link to the source project update, it leaves resources totally orphaned. ##### ENVIRONMENT * AWX version: 12/10 ##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ![Screen Shot 2020-12-10 at 3 48 16 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12446869/101828205-3b3f2e80-3aff-11eb-8fee-455473bdff49.png)</DESCRIPTION>
