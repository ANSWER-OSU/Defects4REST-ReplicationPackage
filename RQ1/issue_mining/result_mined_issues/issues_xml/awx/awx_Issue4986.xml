  <TITLE>Project Add Form</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Feature Idea ##### SUMMARY Hook it up! Every project has the following fields: - Name (input, required) - Description (input) - Organization (single select lookup, required) - SCM Type (dropdown, required) The &quot;new&quot; thing with this form is that it has a variable subform. The subform fields vary based on the value of the scm type. When no scm type is selected, the subform is hidden. There are a handful of different scm type values that can be selected. I'll outline the subform fields for each type: 1. Manual - Project Base Path (disabled input, user cannot edit this - it comes from `PROJECTS_ROOT`) - Playbook Directory (dropdown, required) 2. Git - SCM URL (input, required) - SCM Branch/Tag/Commit - SCM Refspec (input) - SCM Credential (single select lookup - limited to scm type creds) - Options (checkboxes) - Clean - Delete on update - Update revision on launch - When this is checked an additional field (Cache Timeout) is shown (&gt; 0 numerical input) - Allow branch overrride 3. Mercurial - SCM URL (input, required) - SCM Branch/Tag/Commit - SCM Credential (single select lookup - limited to scm type creds) - Options (checkboxes) - Clean - Delete on update - Update revision on launch - When this is checked an additional field (Cache Timeout) is shown (&gt; 0 numerical input) - Allow branch overrride 4. Subversion - SCM URL (input, required) - Revision number (input) - SCM Credential (single select lookup - limited to scm type creds) - Options (checkboxes) - Clean - Delete on update - Update revision on launch - When this is checked an additional field (Cache Timeout) is shown (&gt; 0 numerical input) - Allow branch overrride 5. Red Hat Insights - Credential (single select lookup - limited to insights type creds, required) - Options (checkboxes) - Clean - Delete on update - Update revision on launch - When this is checked an additional field (Cache Timeout) is shown (&gt; 0 numerical input)</DESCRIPTION>
