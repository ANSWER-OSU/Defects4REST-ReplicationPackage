  <TITLE>Kerberos Support in Containers</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Feature Idea ##### SUMMARY Kerberos binaries and configuration don't seem to be currently supported out of the box with AWX. The feature idea here would be to: - add these binaries to the docker containers - add support to the kubernetes installer to provision these configs into the container and run necessary commands to init if parameters for this have been provided. I have read though comments here: https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/735 which was suggesting root / privileged access was required. I have not fully validated this yet but i believe data in the second link would allow this to be resolved. This would utelise the following: - https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/administration/kerberos_auth.html - https://blog.tomecek.net/post/kerberos-in-a-container/ Any additional feedback and requirements appreciated. Cheers!</DESCRIPTION>
