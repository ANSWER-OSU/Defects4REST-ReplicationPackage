It would be great to create this inventory source with the 'awx.awx' ansible collection, which is currently not supported. It is the same with the 'Terraform backend configuration' credential type. ### Select the relevant components - [ ] UI - [ ] API - [ ] Docs - [X] Collection - [ ] CLI - [ ] Other ### Steps to reproduce N/A ### Current results N/A ### Sugested feature result N/A ### Additional information _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
