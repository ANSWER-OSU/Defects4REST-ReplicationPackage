  <TITLE>Teams access tab- Selection of Roles when adding user to team is malfunctioning</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report ##### SUMMARY In the Teams Access tab, when adding a user and setting permissions, the check boxes checking function is not working properly, so the person setting the permissions can check certain boxes and those permissions may or may not be set when the Save button is clicked. Please view both GIFs attached to get a better sense of what is happening. ##### ENVIRONMENT * AWX version: Devel 3/3/2021 ##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE Navigate to the Teams tab, and click on one of the teams listed. Click on the Access tab for that team. Click add, and select User. Select a User to add, and on the next screen, select certain roles. Once boxes are checked, you may or may not be able to uncheck them again. NOTE: You can have all three roles selected, but when you click Save, only one or two may actually have been assigned. GIFs show more detail. ##### EXPECTED RESULTS Add a user to a team and set that user's role permissions successfully. ##### ACTUAL RESULTS Roles may or may not be successfully assigned due to check box malfunctioning. ##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Note: In the following 2 GIFs, I am demonstrating adding the exact same user with the same permissions. Note that the permissions actually set after Save is clicked are different in each GIF. ![team access](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63685497/109827611-e268c900-7c09-11eb-902d-e8184fcc0649.gif) ![team access](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63685497/109827630-e72d7d00-7c09-11eb-9e6a-24470371a574.gif)</DESCRIPTION>
