  <TITLE>Fail when '_' is not used as a prefix as required for certain parameters</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>When a user tries using a parameter that requires a '_' at as a prefix, but doesn't include it, it should fail and mentioned the the '_' is required. For example, if a user doesn't include the '_' as a prefix in '_parallel', then the workflow is executed sequentially, but it's not necessarily obvious that it's not operating as the user expected.</DESCRIPTION>
