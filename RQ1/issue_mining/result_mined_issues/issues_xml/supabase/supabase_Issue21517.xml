  <TITLE>[DOCS] NextJS getting started docs should have a CTA in the end</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION># Improve documentation ## Link [https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/nextjs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/nextjs) ## Describe the problem After the successful completion of the main entry point tutorial for NextJS users (?) &amp; the wonderful output of notes fetch, there isn't any &quot;next step&quot; hinted at. ## Describe the improvement It would be very nice to be guided to the next step or multiple potential next steps. A more guided on-boarding flow with multiple steps is very useful both to the user and Supabase.</DESCRIPTION>
