  <TITLE>Documentation: Migration Guide - Creating a client improvements</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION># Improve documentation ## Link https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/creating-a-client?environment=server-component#creating-a-client ## Describe the problem When upgrading - specifically from the auth-helpers package, it wasn't immediately obvious as to how to implement the new methods. It seemed to be that it was recommended you put the whole code block in every file that would use Supabase Auth. It wasn't until I tried the create-next-app with-supabase and inspected that code, that I realised these should actual be in a utils folder. ## Describe the improvement something along the lines of: &quot;it is recommended to create these functions in a /utils/supabase folder and import them as necessary:&quot; ```ts // /utils/supabase/client.ts import { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/ssr' export const createClient = () =&gt; createBrowserClient( process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!, process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY! ) ``` usage: ```ts // /SomeComponent.tsx &quot;use client&quot; import {createClient} from '@/utils/supabase/client.ts' const Component = () =&gt; { const supabase = createClient() ... } ``` ## Additional context</DESCRIPTION>
