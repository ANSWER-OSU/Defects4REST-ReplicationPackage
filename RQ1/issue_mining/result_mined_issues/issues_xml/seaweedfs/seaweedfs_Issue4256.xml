  <TITLE>local-replicate-compose.yml doesn't seem to work</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** ``` cd docker/compose/; docker-compose -f local-replicate-compose.yml up ``` doesn't seem to work after creating the swexchange and swqueue and the binding exchange to queue in rabbit. First issue is to access s3 container an additional command line option is needed '-ip.bind=0.0.0.0'. When creating s3 objects rabbit never seems to be called. Standing up replicate while the other containers are running doesn't seem to do anything ``` docker-compose -f local-replicate-compose.yml up replicate Attaching to compose-replicate-1 compose-replicate-1 | I0227 22:58:43.034388 config.go:46 Reading : Config File &quot;security&quot; Not Found in &quot;[/data /root/.seaweedfs /usr/local/etc/seaweedfs /etc/seaweedfs]&quot; compose-replicate-1 | I0227 22:58:43.037443 config.go:59 Reading replication.toml from /etc/seaweedfs/replication.toml compose-replicate-1 | I0227 22:58:43.038275 config.go:59 Reading notification.toml from /etc/seaweedfs/notification.toml compose-replicate-1 | No notification is defined in notification.toml file. compose-replicate-1 | Please follow 'weed scaffold -config=notification' to see example notification configurations. compose-replicate-1 exited with code 0 ``` **System Setup** MacOS M1 cpu **Expected behavior** I expect rabbit to have queue count information to go up and replication to populate the /data folder</DESCRIPTION>
