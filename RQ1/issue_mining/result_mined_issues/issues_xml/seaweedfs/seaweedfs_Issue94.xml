  <TITLE>What is the name of this project?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I'm looking to create a Docker image for this project, and maybe some OS-level packages as well. The trouble is, the naming around this project, with regards to its binary, its repo, and its documentation, are contradictory: the documentation refers to it as &quot;Seaweed-FS&quot;, its name on sites like bintray is &quot;seaweed&quot;, its repo name on GitHub is &quot;weed-fs&quot;, and the name of its binary is &quot;weed&quot;. I want to call this project &quot;seaweed&quot;, while its daemon name is &quot;weed&quot;, in a similar fashion to how the &quot;MongoDB&quot; project's binaries are called &quot;mongos&quot; and &quot;mongod&quot;. With this, the name for Docker images for this would be called &quot;seaweed&quot;, and the package names to install this would be &quot;seaweed&quot;. Should there be a different name for external packages? If so, what should this name be?</DESCRIPTION>
