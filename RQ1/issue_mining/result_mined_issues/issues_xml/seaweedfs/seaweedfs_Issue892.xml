  <TITLE>volumes contain multiple duplicate files</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, when I POST a file to the filer server, I noticed that repeated POSTs of the same file do show up in the volumes. Is this because I'm not doing POST by file key? I am currently doing this based on the filer port and the actual file name for easier reading. And if I want to continue using this way for easy reading, should I then do my own checks for file existence? Was wondering about the speed of this check. Thanks for any advice!</DESCRIPTION>
