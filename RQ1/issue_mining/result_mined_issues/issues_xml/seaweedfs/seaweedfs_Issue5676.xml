  <TITLE>Sqlite filer store is missing from Docker &quot;_full&quot; images</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** The sqlite filer store is missing from the full docker image. Attempting to start the filer with an enabled sqlite section in filer.toml produces an error, and the store is not listed when running `filer -help`. **System Setup** - List the command line to start &quot;weed master&quot;, &quot;weed volume&quot;, &quot;weed filer&quot;, &quot;weed s3&quot;, &quot;weed mount&quot;: `docker run chrislusf/seaweedfs:3.68_full filer -help` - output of `weed version`: `version 30GB 3.68 a9cd9b054 linux amd64` (via `docker run chrislusf/seaweedfs:3.68_full version`) **Expected behavior** The standalone binary has the expected behavior: ``` $ ./weed version version 30GB 3.68 a9cd9b0542ef9e2c795baf063d3f7db395ff209b linux amd64 $ ./weed filer -help [...] Supported Filer Stores: arangodb cassandra elastic7 etcd hbase leveldb leveldb2 leveldb3 mongodb mysql mysql2 postgres postgres2 redis redis2 redis2_sentinel redis3 redis3_sentinel redis_cluster redis_cluster2 redis_cluster3 sqlite # present tikv ydb ``` All the other file listed file stores are present in the output from the docker image, except `sqlite`. **Additional context** 1. Commit bf0899cbf4ccb42e02f5984802d41c5e9b5e90bf added sqlite to `binaries_release4.yml`, but `container_release4.yml` wasn't updated at the same time. I don't know if this was intentional or an oversight. 2. This is not a request to add `sqlite` to the standard image. I don't think it would increase the size much, but it clearly hasn't been used before now so I don't think it's necessary. 3. It would be nice if `filer scaffold` didn't output unsupported sections, but that's a separate feature. 4. It would be nice to have a `latest_full` docker tag.</DESCRIPTION>
