  <TITLE>adding header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Could you please include the feature adding individual headers like 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' for responses? Otherwise, like many users (sea Google search) we have to use nginx or apache in front of seaweedfs. That slows the great speed of seaweedfs down and eats unnecessary resources . In the meantime, where do we find this &quot;response part&quot; in the source code, so we would manually add this part and rebuild everything? Thanks</DESCRIPTION>
