  <TITLE>Windows: Network drive mapped by Winfsp, can create, modify but can't remove files.</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>1. Mount a fold from seaweedfs using weed mount on linux. 2. Map the fold as a network drive on windows using [winfsp](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp). \\\\sshfs\root@192.168.1.13, input the root password, got a network drive. 3. creating and modifying files in the network drive worked, but can't not delete files. 4. When deleting files, they exist after refresh the folder. But removing directories works well.</DESCRIPTION>
