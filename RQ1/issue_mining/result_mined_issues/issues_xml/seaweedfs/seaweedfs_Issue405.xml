  <TITLE>Making a volume server readOnly &amp; Some other questions</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We have 1 master volume and 2 volume servers.. Do we have such parameters that so that we can keep a volume just for read operations and dont write anything on it anymore? One more thing. we had a volume server of 70 TB. We first started it with max 2000 volumes and it had been created 763 and we needed to stop it to create more so we stopped it to 765 max. But it is consuming the total 70 TB. why is it so? other hand we have 2370 max volumes in the same 74TB. why 765 taking all the available space?</DESCRIPTION>
