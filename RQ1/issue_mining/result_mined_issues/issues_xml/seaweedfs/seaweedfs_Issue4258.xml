  <TITLE>[Feature Request] Filer browser UI to support more than 100 files at a time</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** The Filer UI displays by default 100 entries. Would like to request to customize that value There is already an option called `-filer.dirListLimit` but it doesn't seem this option applies to the browser UI We have directories that have thousands of files, and always going to the bottom and pressing `Load` is tedious. Would be nice to have some options to find specific files quicker. A few options I can think of: 1. add a search box to filter files based on name 2. add an option like dirListLimit that is customizable 3. add an option to list all files, instead of paginating 100 files at a time **System Setup** ``` &gt; lsb_release -a No LSB modules are available. Distributor ID: Ubuntu Description: Ubuntu 22.10 Release: 22.10 Codename: kinetic &gt; weed version version 30GB 3.42 linux amd64 ``` **Screenshots** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1262715/221906753-81bb370f-dba7-4b2f-841a-bea72adb9000.png)</DESCRIPTION>
