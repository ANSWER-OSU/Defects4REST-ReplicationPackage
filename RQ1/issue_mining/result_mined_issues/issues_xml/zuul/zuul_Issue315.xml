  <TITLE>Namespace confusion is happening with OpenStack's Zuul project</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi! I work on the Zuul project started by OpenStack developers back in 2012: https://github.com/openstack-infra/zuul/tree/1.1.0 We've known for a while that there was a name collision when Netflix released its Zuul project. However, we may need to do something to disambiguate, as we have at least one example of confusion around the name: https://thenewstack.io/ibm-openstack-engineer-urges-cncf-consider-augmenting-jenkins-zuul/ We should work together to find a solution to this. Thanks!</DESCRIPTION>
