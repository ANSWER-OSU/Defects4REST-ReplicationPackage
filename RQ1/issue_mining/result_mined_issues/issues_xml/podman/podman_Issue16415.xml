  <TITLE>In `CONTRIBUTING.MD`, it's mentioned to run the following to do `make lint` and `make validate`</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>In `CONTRIBUTING.MD`, it's mentioned to run the following to do `make lint` and `make validate` `podman build -t gate -f contrib/gate/Dockerfile .` However there's no such file `contrib/gate/Dockerfile` in the repository. Further it's also mentioned to do the following: ``` $ cd $HOME/devel/podman $ podman run -it --rm -v $PWD:/usr/src/libpod:ro \ --security-opt label=disable quay.io/libpod/gate:master \ lint ``` This returns an error: `ERROR: Expecting libpod repository root at /usr/src/libpod (gate container entrypoint)` Also, why can't I just run `make lint` and `make validate`, instead of running these two additional things? Lastly, If I run `make lint`, it doesn't pass and throws errors related to files which I haven't touched, for example: ``` pkg/domain/infra/tunnel/images.go:21:2: &quot;github.com/containers/podman/v4/pkg/errorhandling&quot; imported but not used (typecheck) &quot;github.com/containers/podman/v4/pkg/errorhandling&quot; cmd/podman/containers/ps.go:359:51: l.StartedAt undefined (type psReporter has no field or method StartedAt) (typecheck) t := units.HumanDuration(time.Since(time.Unix(l.StartedAt, 0))) ``` (There were additonal errors, I just copy pasted two of them here) _Originally posted by @tarun360 in https://github.com/containers/podman/discussions/16403_</DESCRIPTION>
