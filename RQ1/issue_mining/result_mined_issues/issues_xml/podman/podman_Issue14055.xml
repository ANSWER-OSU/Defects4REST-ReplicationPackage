  <TITLE>Wrong resolv.conf for --network=host</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- --------------------------------------------------- BUG REPORT INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------- Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment: You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST **NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed in more current versions of the project. Before reporting an issue, please verify the version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md). If they differ, please update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating an issue. Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md), please reference that page before opening a new issue. If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs. --&gt; **Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind bug **Description** With `--network=host` I'd expect the resolv.conf from the host to be used, but it isn't **Steps to reproduce the issue:** 1. sudo podman run --rm -it --privileged --network=host python:3.8 cat /etc/resolv.conf **Describe the results you received:** ``` search home nameserver 10.0.0.138 ``` **Describe the results you expected:** ``` # This is /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf managed by man:systemd-resolved(8). # Do not edit. # # This file might be symlinked as /etc/resolv.conf. If you're looking at # /etc/resolv.conf and seeing this text, you have followed the symlink. # # This is a dynamic resolv.conf file for connecting local clients to the # internal DNS stub resolver of systemd-resolved. This file lists all # configured search domains. # # Run &quot;resolvectl status&quot; to see details about the uplink DNS servers # currently in use. # # Third party programs should typically not access this file directly, but only # through the symlink at /etc/resolv.conf. To manage man:resolv.conf(5) in a # different way, replace this symlink by a static file or a different symlink. # # See man:systemd-resolved.service(8) for details about the supported modes of # operation for /etc/resolv.conf. nameserver 127.0.0.53 options edns0 trust-ad search home ``` **Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):** **Output of `podman version`:** ``` Client: Podman Engine Version: 4.0.2 API Version: 4.0.2 Go Version: go1.18beta2 Built: Thu Mar 3 15:56:09 2022 OS/Arch: linux/amd64 ``` **Output of `podman info --debug`:** ``` host: arch: amd64 buildahVersion: 1.24.1 cgroupControllers: - cpu - io - memory - pids cgroupManager: systemd cgroupVersion: v2 conmon: package: conmon-2.1.0-2.fc36.x86_64 path: /usr/bin/conmon version: 'conmon version 2.1.0, commit: ' cpus: 8 distribution: distribution: fedora variant: workstation version: &quot;36&quot; eventLogger: journald hostname: apollo13 idMappings: gidmap: - container_id: 0 host_id: 1000 size: 1 - container_id: 1 host_id: 100000 size: 65536 uidmap: - container_id: 0 host_id: 1000 size: 1 - container_id: 1 host_id: 100000 size: 65536 kernel: 5.17.3-302.fc36.x86_64 linkmode: dynamic logDriver: journald memFree: 6334738432 memTotal: 16412323840 networkBackend: netavark ociRuntime: name: crun package: crun-1.4.4-1.fc36.x86_64 path: /usr/bin/crun version: |- crun version 1.4.4 commit: 6521fcc5806f20f6187eb933f9f45130c86da230 spec: 1.0.0 +SYSTEMD +SELINUX +APPARMOR +CAP +SECCOMP +EBPF +CRIU +YAJL os: linux remoteSocket: exists: true path: /run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock security: apparmorEnabled: false capabilities: CAP_CHOWN,CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE,CAP_FOWNER,CAP_FSETID,CAP_KILL,CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE,CAP_SETFCAP,CAP_SETGID,CAP_SETPCAP,CAP_SETUID,CAP_SYS_CHROOT rootless: true seccompEnabled: true seccompProfilePath: /usr/share/containers/seccomp.json selinuxEnabled: true serviceIsRemote: false slirp4netns: executable: /usr/bin/slirp4netns package: slirp4netns-1.2.0-0.2.beta.0.fc36.x86_64 version: |- slirp4netns version 1.2.0-beta.0 commit: 477db14a24ff1a3de3a705e51ca2c4c1fe3dda64 libslirp: 4.6.1 SLIRP_CONFIG_VERSION_MAX: 3 libseccomp: 2.5.3 swapFree: 42949664768 swapTotal: 42949664768 uptime: 53m 58.88s plugins: log: - k8s-file - none - passthrough - journald network: - bridge - macvlan volume: - local registries: search: - registry.fedoraproject.org - registry.access.redhat.com - docker.io - quay.io store: configFile: /home/florian/.config/containers/storage.conf containerStore: number: 2 paused: 0 running: 0 stopped: 2 graphDriverName: overlay graphOptions: {} graphRoot: /home/florian/.local/share/containers/storage graphStatus: Backing Filesystem: extfs Native Overlay Diff: &quot;true&quot; Supports d_type: &quot;true&quot; Using metacopy: &quot;false&quot; imageCopyTmpDir: /var/tmp imageStore: number: 73 runRoot: /run/user/1000/containers volumePath: /home/florian/.local/share/containers/storage/volumes version: APIVersion: 4.0.2 Built: 1646319369 BuiltTime: Thu Mar 3 15:56:09 2022 GitCommit: &quot;&quot; GoVersion: go1.18beta2 OsArch: linux/amd64 Version: 4.0.2 ``` **Package info (e.g. output of `rpm -q podman` or `apt list podman`):** ``` podman-4.0.2-1.fc36.x86_64 ``` **Have you tested with the latest version of Podman and have you checked the Podman Troubleshooting Guide?

    <MESSAGE>fix incorrect permissions for /etc/resolv.conf in userns The files /etc/hosts, /etc/hostname and /etc/resolv.conf should always be owned by the root user in the container. This worked correct for /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts but not for /etc/resolv.conf. A container run with --userns keep-id would have the reolv.conf file owned by the current container user which is wrong. Consolidate some common code in a new helper function to make the code more cleaner. Signed-off-by: Paul Holzinger &lt;pholzing@redhat.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
