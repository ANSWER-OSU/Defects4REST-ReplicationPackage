  <TITLE>podman pod inspect not working for more than one argument</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- --------------------------------------------------- BUG REPORT INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------- Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment: You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST **NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed in more current versions of the project. Before reporting an issue, please verify the version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md). If they differ, please update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating an issue. Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md), please reference that page before opening a new issue. If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs. --&gt; **Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind bug **Description** The documentation states that podman pod inspect accepts one or more arguments (pod names or ids). This also matches the behavior of all other inspect commands. However in reality only the first argument is used and all extra arguments are silently ignored. **Steps to reproduce the issue:** 1. `podman pod create --name p1` 2. `podman pod create --name p2` 3. `podman pod inspect p1 p2` **Describe the results you received:** Inspect output for only the first pod p1 **Describe the results you expected:** Inspect output for both pods. **Output of `podman version`:** latest main</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>fix podman pod inspect to support multiple pods Just like the other inspect commands `podman pod inspect p1 p2` should return the json for both. To correctly implement this we follow the container inspect logic, this allows use to reuse the global inspect command. Note: To not break the existing single pod output format for podman pod inspect I added a pod-legacy inspect type. This is only used to make sure we will print the pod as single json and not an array like for the other commands. We cannot use the pod type since podman inspect --type pod did return an array and we should not break that as well. Fixes #15674 Signed-off-by: Paul Holzinger &lt;pholzing@redhat.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
