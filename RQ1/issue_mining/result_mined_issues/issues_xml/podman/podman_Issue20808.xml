  <TITLE>prefer podman's installer binary (gvproxy, qemu) over system wide binaries</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Feature request description if I install podman on my computer using installer and have for example an old brew install or any other installation 1. podman will start gvproxy from `/usr/local/bin` folder ``` benoitf 86983 0.0 0.0 409869360 32800 s013 S 11:44AM 0:00.14 /usr/local/bin/gvproxy -listen-qemu unix:///var/folders/_s/rlbw3qg15vx0j6vr4l7kd1hm0000gn/T/podman/qmp_podman-machine-default.sock ``` I would expect that it launches gvproxy from `/opt/podman` folder my `podman` binary comes from `/opt/podman/bin/podman` and in `/opt/podman/bin` there is a gvproxy binary I would expect that it launches it from this `/opt/podman/bin` folder to avoid to mix with other binaries that might not be compliant with the one podman binary expects. 2. podman will start qemu from brew folder and not from /opt/podman for example I have one process which is: ``` /opt/homebrew/bin/qemu-system-aarch64 ``` ```bash /opt/podman/qemu/bin/qemu-system-aarch64 --version QEMU emulator version 8.0.0 Copyright (c) 2003-2022 Fabrice Bellard and the QEMU Project developers ``` ```bash /opt/podman/qemu/bin/qemu-system-aarch64 --version QEMU emulator version 8.1.1 Copyright (c) 2003-2023 Fabrice Bellard and the QEMU Project developers ``` ### Suggest potential solution A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. ### Have you considered any alternatives? A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. ### Additional context I would have assumed that it would use https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/contrib/pkginstaller/package.sh#L10 but it seems it still take my system binaries and not the one provided by the installer</DESCRIPTION>
