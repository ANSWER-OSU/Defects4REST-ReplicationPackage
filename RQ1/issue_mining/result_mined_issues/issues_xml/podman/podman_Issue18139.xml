For the time being, both tools will be enabled so that we may catch any &quot;missing&quot; update problems. ### Suggest potential solution After 30-ish days, the .github/dependabot.yml file should be removed and Dependabot disabled in the repo. settings. ### Have you considered any alternatives? Renovate is the alternative ### Additional context _No response_</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>[CI:DOCS] Disable Dependabot in favor of Renovate Fixes: #18139 Removing the Dependabot configuration file is a required prerequisite to stopping it from opening update PRs. Once this commit is merged, the `Dependabot security updates` repo. setting may also be disabled. Note: The `Dependabot alerts` setting should remain enabled, this provides security-data to renovate for opening important vulnerability fix PRs.
