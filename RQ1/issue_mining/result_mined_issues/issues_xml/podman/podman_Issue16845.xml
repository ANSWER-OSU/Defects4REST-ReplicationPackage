  <TITLE>Description of pull option in command line help for run command doesn't contain allowed values</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind feature **Description** When using the `podman run` command, I wanted to know how to set the pull policy, so I tried to look it up using `podman run --help`. However the output for this option doesn't contain all the possible values (see below), contrary to the output of other options such as sdnotify. So I had to look it up in the documentation, where it was thankfully described. **Steps to reproduce the issue:** 1. Run the following command: $ podman run --help 2. Look for the description of the pull option **Describe the results you received:** Among other option descriptions, the following was printed for the pull option: &gt; --pull string Pull image policy (default &quot;missing&quot;) The description in the documentation of podman lists all possible values, but as you can see, the command line help does not. **Describe the results you expected:** When using docker as a comparison (sorry), the following is printed there: &gt; --pull string Pull image before running (&quot;always&quot;|&quot;missing&quot;|&quot;never&quot;) (default &quot;missing&quot;) I expected something similar for podman. Other options that can have multiple possible values list them all. Suggestion for the description of the pull option: &gt; --pull string Pull image policy (&quot;always&quot;|&quot;missing&quot;|&quot;never&quot;|&quot;newer&quot;) (default &quot;missing&quot;) **Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):** - **Output of `podman version`:** ``` Client: Podman Engine Version: 4.3.1 API Version: 4.3.1 Go Version: go1.19.2 Built: Fri Nov 11 16:01:27 2022 OS/Arch: linux/amd64 ``` **Output of `podman info`:** I don't think that's relevant here. **Package info (e.g. output of `rpm -q podman` or `apt list podman` or `brew info podman`):** ``` $ rpm -q podman podman-4.3.1-1.fc37.x86_64 ``` **Have you tested with the latest version of Podman and have you checked [the Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md)?** Yes **Additional environment details (AWS, VirtualBox, physical, etc.):** Fedora 37 default installation</DESCRIPTION>
