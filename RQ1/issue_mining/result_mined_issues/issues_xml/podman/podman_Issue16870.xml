  <TITLE>`podman export` to piped command results in `Error: open /dev/stdout: permission denied`</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- --------------------------------------------------- BUG REPORT INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------- Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment: You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST **NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed in more current versions of the project. Before reporting an issue, please verify the version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md). If they differ, please update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating an issue. Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md), please reference that page before opening a new issue. If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs. --&gt; **Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind bug **Description** &lt;!-- Briefly describe the problem you are having in a few paragraphs. --&gt; **Steps to reproduce the issue:** 1. `podman export container-name | tar -C container-fs -xv` **Describe the results you received:** ``` Error: open /dev/stdout: permission denied ``` **Describe the results you expected:** Container export contents should pipe to the following command without error, and export contents should present at the specified location **Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):** It appears that this is a bug similar to: https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12402 That issue was fixed by changing the call from `os.Create` to `os.OpenFile` with the correct flags.

      <MESSAGE>export: use io.Writer instead of file This allows use to use STDOUT directly without having to call open again, also this makes the export API endpoint much more performant since it no longer needs to copy to a temp file. I noticed that there was no export API test so I added one. And lastly opening /dev/stdout will not work on windows. Fixes #16870 Signed-off-by: Paul Holzinger &lt;pholzing@redhat.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
