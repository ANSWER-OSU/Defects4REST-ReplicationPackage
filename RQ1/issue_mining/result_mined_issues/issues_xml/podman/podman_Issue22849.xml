  <TITLE>podman exec [mandatory command?]</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Description At https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-exec.1.html the synopsis is: &gt; podman exec [options] container [command [arg …]] &gt; podman container exec [options] container [command [arg …]] For me this means that the `command` argument is optional. The webpage does not say what is the default command, if `command` does not follow `exec`. So I thought it will be the Containerfile’s `ENTRYPOINT`. But it is not: ``` $ podman exec -ti uuu Error: must provide a non-empty command to start an exec session: invalid argument ``` The problem report is that the synopsys at the aforementioned web page, and the synopsis printed by `podman exec --help` wrongly suggest, that COMMAND is optional, by putting it between square brackets. ### Steps to reproduce the issue Not applicable. ### Describe the results you received Describe the results you received ### Describe the results you expected Not applicable. ### podman info output ```yaml podman 5.0.3 on darwin/amd64. ``` ### Podman in a container No ### Privileged Or Rootless None ### Upstream Latest Release Yes ### Additional environment details Additional environment details ### Additional information Additional information like issue happens only occasionally or issue happens with a particular architecture or on a particular setting</DESCRIPTION>
