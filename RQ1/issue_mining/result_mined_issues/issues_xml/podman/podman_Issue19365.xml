  <TITLE>Tutorial - Podman Socket Activation</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I've been trialling Podman using the following tutorial: https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/socket_activation.md I've had mixed success depending on the distro I'm using: - Fedora 36: tutorial works first time. - Oracle Liunx 9: tutorial works first time. - Redhat 8: tutorial gives 'connection refused' error. - Oracle Linux 8: tutorial gives 'connection refused' error. I may be wrong, but I think the only differences between the distros is the cgroup. In the Redhat 8 and Oracle Linux 8, the cgroup is v1. In Fedora 36 and Oracle Liunx 9, the cgroup is v2. So it appears, for this particular tutorial at least, that you need a distro running cgroup v2. Not sure if there is something else different that I'm not aware of. Would be very helpful, to avoid wasting countless weeks on tutorials that don't work, by adding a comment somewhere in the tutorial page that cgroup v2 is required.....</DESCRIPTION>
