  <TITLE>podman logs --since --follow: missing output</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>New flake: ``` not ok 108 podman logs - --since --follow journald ... $ podman logs --since 0.1s -f T37slH9xww timeout: sending signal TERM to command ?/var/tmp/go/src/github.com/containers/podman/bin/podman? [ rc=124 (expected) ] #/vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv #| FAIL: logs --since -f on running container works #| expected: =~ \^wxTfKjwkoo #| &gt; timeout: sending signal TERM to command.\* #| actual: timeout: sending signal TERM to command ?/var/tmp/go/src/github.com/containers/podman/bin/podman? ``` Suspiciously similar to #17286, but that one is `--until`, this one is `--since`; and that one is `k8s-file`, this one `journald`; and that one was remote-only, this one is happening local too. First seen today, which is -- coincidentally or not -- after the merge of #17305 (new CI VMs) and #17603 (Ed's proposed fix for the other `logs --follow` flake). * fedora-36 : sys podman fedora-36 rootless host * PR #17589 * [02-23 06:49](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/v1/artifact/task/6669329605853184/html/sys-podman-fedora-36-rootless-host.log.html#t--00108) in [sys] podman logs - --since --follow journald * fedora-36 : sys remote fedora-36 root host [remote] * PR #17601 * [02-23 04:25](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/v1/artifact/task/6359623121240064/html/sys-remote-fedora-36-root-host.log.html#t--00108) in [sys] podman logs - --since --follow journald</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>fix &quot;podman logs --since --follow&quot; flake The test should make sure the logs --follow call will log entries that are created in the future when --since is used and doe not include the container start event. However it seems the timing is to tight. I think it was possible that CI logged the line before the logs call was made, thus it is missing because --since excluded it. I cannot reproduce so I am not 100% on this but we can reopen the issue if it still happens. Fixes #17616 Signed-off-by: Paul Holzinger &lt;pholzing@redhat.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
