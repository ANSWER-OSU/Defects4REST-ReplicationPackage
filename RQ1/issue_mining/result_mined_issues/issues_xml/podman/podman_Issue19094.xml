      <MESSAGE>[CI:BUILD] Packit: fix pre-sync action for downstream tasks One of the reasons the last propose-downstream task failed for Fedora was the `golist` tool wasn't available in the Packit environment. This commit adds golist to the environment by downloading and extracting the golist rpm. This dependency could've been added in packit's upstream config but there were a few blockers, so it's easiest to add them in our action script.
