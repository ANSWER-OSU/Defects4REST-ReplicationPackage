  <TITLE>tests: stop harassing fubar.com</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>There are many instances of `server.fubar.com` in the tests. I'm sure this is intended as `no-such-host`, but there is an actual A record for this. It is a genuine live system. In `system connection test` this usage is uncomfortable but harmless: there is no actual connection. In [image scp](https://storage.googleapis.com/cirrus-ci-6707778565701632-fcae48/artifacts/containers/podman/5977150636425216/html/int-podman-fedora-36-root-host.log.html#t--podman-image-scp-with-proper-connection--1) there is an actual attempt to `scp`, which the server owner could, quite rightly, see as an attack. @cdoern please make it a priority to fix this ASAP. I would also encourage you to fix system connection tests as well, simply as much-needed cleanup. (As a bonus, this will give us back 30-40 seconds).</DESCRIPTION>
