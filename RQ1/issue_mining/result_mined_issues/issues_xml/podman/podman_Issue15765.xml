  <TITLE>memory Limit is returning invalid result for `/container/stats` REST API on macOS</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- --------------------------------------------------- BUG REPORT INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------- Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment: You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST **NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed in more current versions of the project. Before reporting an issue, please verify the version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md). If they differ, please update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating an issue. Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md), please reference that page before opening a new issue. If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs. --&gt; **Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind bug **Description** The field `memory_stats.limit` is returning an invalid value **Steps to reproduce the issue:** 1. Start a dummy container like fedora ```bash $ MY_DUMMY_CONTAINER=$(podman run -d fedora sleep 20000) ``` 2. Display the memory of the container from inside the container ```bash $ podman exec -ti $MY_DUMMY_CONTAINER cat /proc/meminfo | head -3 MemTotal: 2018452 kB MemFree: 860084 kB MemAvailable: 1556036 kB ``` 3. Now, read the value returned by the REST API ```bash curl --silent --unix-socket /Users/benoitf/.local/share/containers/podman/machine/podman-machine-default/podman.sock &quot;http:/v1.41/containers/$MY_DUMMY_CONTAINER/stats?stream=false&amp;one-shot=true&quot; | jq .memory_stats { &quot;usage&quot;: 94208, &quot;max_usage&quot;: 18446744073709552000, &quot;limit&quot;: 18446744073709552000 } ``` **Describe the results you received:** ``` &quot;limit&quot;: 18446744073709552000 ``` it seems this value is like the maximum value of the int/long/etc **Describe the results you expected:** something displaying around 2GB / 2Gi because it's the size of the machine. ``` &quot;limit&quot;: 2066894848 ``` and based from https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.41/#tag/Container/operation/ContainerStats ``` used_memory = memory_stats.usage - memory_stats.stats.cache available_memory = memory_stats.limit Memory usage % = (used_memory / available_memory) * 100.0 ``` **Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):** **Output of `podman version`:** ``` 4.2.1 ``` **Output of `podman info`:** ``` 4.2.1 ``` **Package info (e.g. output of `rpm -q podman` or `apt list podman`):** ``` (paste your output here) ``` **Have you tested with the latest version of Podman and have you checked the Podman Troubleshooting Guide? (https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md)** Yes/No **Additional environment details (AWS, VirtualBox, physical, etc.):**</DESCRIPTION>
