  <TITLE>Image conflict should return HTTP 409</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- --------------------------------------------------- BUG REPORT INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------- Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment: You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST **NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed in more current versions of the project. Before reporting an issue, please verify the version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md). If they differ, please update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating an issue. Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md), please reference that page before opening a new issue. If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs. --&gt; **Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind feature **Description** &lt;!-- Briefly describe the problem you are having in a few paragraphs. --&gt; **Steps to reproduce the issue:** 1. Attempt to delete image which is still being used by a container using `DELETE /images/sha256:xxxx` **Describe the results you received:** API returns HTTP 500. **Describe the results you expected:** Given the Docker API returns the more appropriate HTTP 409 (CONFLICT), I expected Podman to return 409 as well. **Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):** I think it would not only be more appropriate to use a HTTP response with the matching description, but I too think it would help compatibility with Docker API clients. In my case I am using the Docker Java API, which would return a appropriate conflict exception on Docker's 409 response, whereas Podman's 500 results in a very generic server error.</DESCRIPTION>
