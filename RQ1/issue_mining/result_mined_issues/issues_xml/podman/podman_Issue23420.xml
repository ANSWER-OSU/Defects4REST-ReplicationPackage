    <MESSAGE>[v5.2] update buildah-bud buildah-tests.diff When trying to vendor Buildah v1.37.0, all kinds of mayhem ensued. I followed https://github.com/containers/podman/tree/main/test/buildah-bud and the result was this diff file. I'm not sure if this is right, and as I'm in a very deep dark corner of the project that I've not been in before, I'll ask @edsantiago to throw the life ring if necessary.
