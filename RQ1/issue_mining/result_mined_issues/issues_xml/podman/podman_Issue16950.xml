  <TITLE>podman logs: `--follow` does not always work in combination with `--since`</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- --------------------------------------------------- BUG REPORT INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------- Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment: You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST **NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed in more current versions of the project. Before reporting an issue, please verify the version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md). If they differ, please update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating an issue. Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md), please reference that page before opening a new issue. If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs. --&gt; **Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind bug **Description** &lt;!-- Briefly describe the problem you are having in a few paragraphs. --&gt; Logs are not always followed when `--follow` is used in combination with `--since`. It seems that a certain threshold must be hit to make it follow the logs **Steps to reproduce the issue:** 1. Start a container that logs something every 5 seconds: ``` $ podman run --name ticker alpine sh -c &quot;while :; do echo &quot;tick&quot; &amp;&amp; sleep 5; done&quot; ``` 2. Wait approximately 10 seconds 3. Now try to retrieve the logs since 1 sec ago and keep following it by issuing ``` $ podman logs --timestamps --follow --since $(date +%s -d &quot;1 sec ago&quot;) ticker ``` 4. The logs are not followed. 5. Repeat step 3 but multiply the seconds by 10. Here is a video depicting the issue: [Bildschirmaufzeichnung vom 2022-12-27, 23-30-01.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3630213/209729197-0b9274de-de55-4aff-bb52-9b14afe2759d.webm) **Describe the results you received:** Following the logs doesn't work as long as the timestamp passed in `--since` is after the timestamp of the first log line of the container. In this specific case, 100 seconds should work (see step 3): ``` $ podman logs --timestamps --follow --since $(date +%s -d &quot;100 sec ago&quot;) ticker ``` **Describe the results you expected:** The logs are being followed if I specify `--follow`, no matter what. **Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):** **Output of `podman version`:** ``` Client: Podman Engine Version: 4.3.1 API Version: 4.3.1 Go Version: go1.19.2 Built: Fri Nov 11 16:01:27 2022 OS/Arch: linux/amd64 ``` **Output of `podman info`:** ``` host: arch: amd64 buildahVersion: 1.28.0 cgroupControllers: - memory - pids cgroupManager: systemd cgroupVersion: v2 conmon: package: conmon-2.1.5-1.fc37.x86_64 path: /usr/bin/conmon version: 'conmon version 2.1.5, commit: ' cpuUtilization: idlePercent: 75.73 systemPercent: 5.07 userPercent: 19.2 cpus: 16 distribution: distribution: fedora variant: silverblue version: &quot;37&quot; eventLogger: journald hostname: asus-tuf-gaming-X570-plus idMappings: gidmap: - container_id: 0 host_id: 1000 size: 1 - container_id: 1 host_id: 100000 size: 65536 uidmap: - container_id: 0 host_id: 1000 size: 1 - container_id: 1 host_id: 100000 size: 65536 kernel: 6.0.14-300.fc37.x86_64 linkmode: dynamic logDriver: journald memFree: 3759407104 memTotal: 33560997888 networkBackend: cni ociRuntime: name: crun package: crun-1.7.2-2.fc37.x86_64 path: /usr/bin/crun version: |- crun version 1.7.2 commit: 0356bf4aff9a133d655dc13b1d9ac9424706cac4 rundir: /run/user/1000/crun spec: 1.0.0 +SYSTEMD +SELINUX +APPARMOR +CAP +SECCOMP +EBPF +CRIU +LIBKRUN +WASM:wasmedge +YAJL os: linux remoteSocket: exists: true path: /run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock security: apparmorEnabled: false capabilities: CAP_CHOWN,CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE,CAP_FOWNER,CAP_FSETID,CAP_KILL,CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE,CAP_SETFCAP,CAP_SETGID,CAP_SETPCAP,CAP_SETUID,CAP_SYS_CHROOT rootless: true seccompEnabled: true seccompProfilePath: /usr/share/containers/seccomp.json selinuxEnabled: true serviceIsRemote: false slirp4netns: executable: /usr/bin/slirp4netns package: slirp4netns-1.2.0-8.fc37.x86_64 version: |- slirp4netns version 1.2.0 commit: 656041d45cfca7a4176f6b7eed9e4fe6c11e8383 libslirp: 4.7.0 SLIRP_CONFIG_VERSION_MAX: 4 libseccomp: 2.5.3 swapFree: 1313239040 swapTotal: 8589930496 uptime: 34h 4m 30.00s (Approximately 1.42 days) plugins: authorization: null log: - k8s-file - none - passthrough - journald network: - bridge - macvlan - ipvlan volume: - local registries: search: - registry.fedoraproject.org - registry.access.redhat.com - docker.io - quay.io store: configFile: /var/home/marcus/.config/containers/storage.conf containerStore: number: 13 paused: 3 running: 6 stopped: 4 graphDriverName: overlay graphOptions: {} graphRoot: /var/home/marcus/.local/share/containers/storage graphRootAllocated: 3248905781248 graphRootUsed: 487188070400 graphStatus: Backing Filesystem: btrfs Native Overlay Diff: &quot;true&quot; Supports d_type: &quot;true&quot; Using metacopy: &quot;false&quot; imageCopyTmpDir: /var/tmp imageStore: number: 19 runRoot: /run/user/1000/containers volumePath: /var/home/marcus/.local/share/containers/storage/volumes version: APIVersion: 4.3.1 Built: 1668178887 BuiltTime: Fri Nov 11 16:01:27 2022 GitCommit: &quot;&quot; GoVersion: go1.19.2 Os: linux OsArch: linux/amd64 Version: 4.3.1 ``` **Package info (e.g. output of `rpm -q podman` or `apt list podman` or `brew info podman`):** ``` podman-4.3.1-1.fc37.x86_64 ``` **Have you tested with the latest version of Podman and have you checked [the Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md)?** I did check the troubleshooting page, but haven't checked the latest git version of podman. **Additional environment details (AWS, VirtualBox, physical, etc.):**</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>podman logs: journald fix --since and --follow The `containerCouldBeLogging` bool should not be false by default, when --since is used we seek in the journal and can miss the start event so that bool would stay false forever. This means that a running container is not followed even when it should. To fix this we can just set the `containerCouldBeLogging` bool based on the current contianer state.
