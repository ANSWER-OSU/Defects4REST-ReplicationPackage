  <TITLE>include arch/os in image libpod list</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Feature request description Today, ``` &quot;Architecture&quot;: &quot;arm64&quot;, &quot;Os&quot;: &quot;linux&quot;, ``` are only available when we inspect an image But usually this information is useful when we want to list images. For example to know if an image is using `amd64` or Apple Silicon computer, etc. so it requires one additional query for each image. ### Suggest potential solution Include ```json &quot;Architecture&quot;: &quot;arm64&quot;, &quot;Os&quot;: &quot;linux&quot;, ``` as part of `libpod/images/json` return this information could be with an additional query parameter to the endpoint `?arch=true&amp;os=true`, `?displayArchAndOs`, whatever so opt-in query. ### Have you considered any alternatives?

      <MESSAGE>Add os, arch, and ismanifest to libpod image list when listing images through the restful service, consumers want to know if the image they are listing is a manifest or not because the libpod endpoint returns both images and manifest lists. in addition, we now add `arch` and `os` as fields in the libpod endpoint for image listing as well.
