      <MESSAGE>CI: reenable tests that are working again - #15074 (&quot;subtree_control&quot; flake). The flake is NOT FIXED, I saw it six months ago on my (non-aarch64) laptop. However, it looks like the frequent-flake-on-aarch64 bug is resolved. I've been testing in #17831 and have not seen it. So, tentatively remove the skip and see what happens. - Closes: #19407 (broken tar, &quot;duplicates of file paths&quot;) All Fedoras now have a fixed tar. Debian DOES NOT, but we're handling that in our build-ci-vm code. I.e., the Debian VM we're using has a working tar even though there's currently a broken tar out in the wild. Added distro-integration tag so we can catch future problems like this in OpenQA. - Closes: #19471 (brq / blkio / loopbackfs in rawhide) Bug appears to be fixed in rawhide, at least in the VMs we're using now. Added distro-integration tag because this test obviously relies on other system stuff. Signed-off-by: Ed Santiago &lt;santiago@redhat.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
