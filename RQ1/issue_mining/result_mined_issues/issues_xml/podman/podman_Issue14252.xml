  <TITLE>container/pod refuse to be removed cause defunct exec session process</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- --------------------------------------------------- BUG REPORT INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------- Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment: You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST **NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed in more current versions of the project. Before reporting an issue, please verify the version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md). If they differ, please update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating an issue. Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md), please reference that page before opening a new issue. If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs. --&gt; **Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind bug **Description** &lt;!-- Briefly describe the problem you are having in a few paragraphs. --&gt; Podman container/pod refuse to be removed cause active exec session. But the exec session is just a defunc zombie process and will never been kill or cleanup. We can only reboot the system to clean zombie process and pod/container. **Steps to reproduce the issue:** Sorry, but I don't know how to create a zombie exec session (it just happened). **Describe the results you received:** b094f727f1dd4dc06f7743a061b2d2ece691eb59adfc3c4e4791d0b2ae16ac62 has containers that are not ready to be removed: cannot remove container 585ec09d8b1ec7c5ff2791261e30829dc117c838f0e9d925eb25263a8182ec37 as it has active exec sessions: container state improper **Describe the results you expected:** container/pod removed successfully. `podman pod rm -f` should ignore defunct zombie exec session cause they will never be killed during system up also unnecessary. **Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):** **Output of `podman version`:** ``` Version: 3.4.0 API Version: 3.4.0 Go Version: go1.17.1 Built: Mon Oct 18 11:00:12 2021 OS/Arch: linux/amd64 ``` **Output of `podman info --debug`:** ``` host: arch: amd64 buildahVersion: 1.23.1 cgroupControllers: [] cgroupManager: cgroupfs cgroupVersion: v1 conmon: package: app-containers/conmon-2.0.27 path: /usr/libexec/podman/conmon version: 'conmon version 2.0.27, commit: v2.0.27' cpus: 48 distribution: distribution: gentoo version: unknown eventLogger: file hostname: hithlan2 idMappings: gidmap: - container_id: 0 host_id: 2392 size: 1 - container_id: 1 host_id: 362144 size: 65536 uidmap: - container_id: 0 host_id: 2392 size: 1 - container_id: 1 host_id: 362144 size: 65536 kernel: 5.10.27-gentoo linkmode: dynamic logDriver: k8s-file memFree: 91562278912 memTotal: 202617040896 ociRuntime: name: crun package: app-containers/crun-1.2 path: /usr/bin/crun version: |- crun version 1.2 commit: 4f6c8e0583c679bfee6a899c05ac6b916022561b spec: 1.0.0 +SELINUX +APPARMOR +CAP +SECCOMP +EBPF +YAJL os: linux remoteSocket: path: /tmp/podman-run-2392/podman/podman.sock security: apparmorEnabled: false capabilities: CAP_AUDIT_WRITE,CAP_CHOWN,CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE,CAP_FOWNER,CAP_FSETID,CAP_KILL,CAP_MKNOD,CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE,CAP_NET_RAW,CAP_SETFCAP,CAP_SETGID,CAP_SETPCAP,CAP_SETUID,CAP_SYS_CHROOT rootless: true ``` **Package info (e.g. output of `rpm -q podman` or `apt list podman`):** ``` [?] app-emulation/podman [1] Available versions: ~3.3.0_rc3^t {apparmor btrfs +fuse +rootless selinux} Installed versions: 3.4.0^st{tbz2}(11:00:45 AM 10/18/2021)(fuse rootless -apparmor -btrfs -selinux) Homepage: https://github.com/containers/podman/ Description: Library and podman tool for running OCI-based containers in Pods ``` **Have you tested with the latest version of Podman and have you checked the Podman Troubleshooting Guide?

      <MESSAGE>Make errors on removing exec sessions nonfatal Removing exec sessions is guaranteed to evict them from the DB, but in the case of a zombie process (or similar) it may error and block removal of the container. A subsequent run of `podman rm` would succeed (because the exec sessions have been purged from the DB), which is potentially confusing to users. So let's just continue, instead of erroring out, if removing exec sessions fails. [NO NEW TESTS NEEDED] I wouldn't want to spawn a zombie in our test VMs even if I could.
