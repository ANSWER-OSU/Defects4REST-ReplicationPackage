  <TITLE>podman stats as root broken</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- --------------------------------------------------- BUG REPORT INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------- Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment: You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST **NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed in more current versions of the project. Before reporting an issue, please verify the version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md). If they differ, please update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating an issue. Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md), please reference that page before opening a new issue. If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs. --&gt; **Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind bug **Description** &lt;!-- Briefly describe the problem you are having in a few paragraphs. --&gt; **Steps to reproduce the issue:** 1. Install podman on Arch Linux (4.0.3), Centos 8 Stream (4.0.2) or use Fedora Coreos (4.0.2) 2. log in as root 3. `podman stats` **Describe the results you received:** It just prints `Error: Link not found` **Describe the results you expected:** not that **Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):** `podman stats` seems to work when run as non-root, tested on Arch Linux, but I get the same error there when run as root. Using the socket API: `curl --unix-socket /run/podman/podman.sock 'http://d/v4.0.0/libpod/containers/stats'` {&quot;Error&quot;:{},&quot;Stats&quot;:null} **Output of `podman version`:** 4.0.3 and 4.0.2 ** podman info -D ** From coreos: ``` host: arch: amd64 buildahVersion: 1.24.1 cgroupControllers: - cpuset - cpu - io - memory - hugetlb - pids - misc cgroupManager: systemd cgroupVersion: v2 conmon: package: conmon-2.1.0-2.fc36.x86_64 path: /usr/bin/conmon version: 'conmon version 2.1.0, commit: ' cpus: 4 distribution: distribution: fedora variant: coreos version: &quot;36&quot; eventLogger: journald hostname: dro-1 idMappings: gidmap: null uidmap: null kernel: 5.17.0-300.fc36.x86_64 linkmode: dynamic logDriver: journald memFree: 14985670656 memTotal: 16773632000 networkBackend: netavark ociRuntime: name: crun package: crun-1.4.3-1.fc36.x86_64 path: /usr/bin/crun version: |- crun version 1.4.3 commit: 61c9600d1335127eba65632731e2d72bc3f0b9e8 spec: 1.0.0 +SYSTEMD +SELINUX +APPARMOR +CAP +SECCOMP +EBPF +CRIU +YAJL os: linux remoteSocket: exists: true path: /run/podman/podman.sock security: apparmorEnabled: false capabilities: CAP_CHOWN,CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE,CAP_FOWNER,CAP_FSETID,CAP_KILL,CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE,CAP_SETFCAP,CAP_SETGID,CAP_SETPCAP,CAP_SETUID,CAP_SYS_CHROOT rootless: false seccompEnabled: true seccompProfilePath: /usr/share/containers/seccomp.json selinuxEnabled: true serviceIsRemote: false slirp4netns: executable: /usr/bin/slirp4netns package: slirp4netns-1.2.0-0.2.beta.0.fc36.x86_64 version: |- slirp4netns version 1.2.0-beta.0 commit: 477db14a24ff1a3de3a705e51ca2c4c1fe3dda64 libslirp: 4.6.1 SLIRP_CONFIG_VERSION_MAX: 3 libseccomp: 2.5.3 swapFree: 0 swapTotal: 0 uptime: 40h 43m 52.05s (Approximately 1.67 days) plugins: log: - k8s-file - none - passthrough - journald network: - bridge - macvlan volume: - local registries: search: - registry.fedoraproject.org - registry.access.redhat.com - docker.io - quay.io store: configFile: /usr/share/containers/storage.conf containerStore: number: 11 paused: 0 running: 11 stopped: 0 graphDriverName: overlay graphOptions: overlay.mountopt: nodev,metacopy=on graphRoot: /var/lib/containers/storage graphStatus: Backing Filesystem: xfs Native Overlay Diff: &quot;false&quot; Supports d_type: &quot;true&quot; Using metacopy: &quot;true&quot; imageCopyTmpDir: /var/tmp imageStore: number: 8 runRoot: /run/containers/storage volumePath: /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes version: APIVersion: 4.0.2 Built: 1646319369 BuiltTime: Thu Mar 3 14:56:09 2022 GitCommit: &quot;&quot; GoVersion: go1.18beta2 OsArch: linux/amd64 Version: 4.0.2 ```</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>podman stats: work with network connect/disconnect Hardcoding the interface name is a bad idea. We have no control over the actual interface name since the user can change it. The correct thing is to read them from the network status. Since the contianer can have more than one interface we have to add the RX/TX values. The other values are currently not used. For podman 5.0 we should change it so that the API can return the statistics per interface and the client should sum the TX/RX for the command output. This is what docker is doing.
