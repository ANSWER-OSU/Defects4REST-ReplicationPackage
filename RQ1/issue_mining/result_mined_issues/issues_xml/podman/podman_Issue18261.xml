  <TITLE>Add CI self-destruct to the v3.0.1-rhel branch</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Feature request description Based on current info., this branch will be completely out of support on 2025-05-01 with no chance any CVE fix will get backported. However, while these dates can change, it's worth encoding this into an automated notice which can't be overlooked - given the ever growing number of release-branches being maintained. ### Suggest potential solution Port the self-destruct conditional from https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/18233 to the `v3.0.1-rhel` branch on/after May 2023 - to ensure it doesn't falsely trigger for some reason. ### Have you considered any alternatives? Yes, this is a much better solution than expecting a sticky-note to stay stuck for 2 years. ### Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.</DESCRIPTION>
