  <TITLE>Add VAT free &amp; VAT amounts to payment view</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Feature Request On the payment input view, in the table that lists various payment information, it could be useful, in some cases, to also have VAT free (HT) and VAT (TVA) amounts. These 2 new columns would be just before the Amount including VAT column as in the suggested implementation below. ![new-show-vat-free-amount-payment-input](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/assets/31100265/1ef68b61-97d4-4e64-92aa-f0cb499565b9) In order to keep importance on the full amount on which we are checking and entering a payment for, we could use `font-weight: bold` on the _Amount (inc. tax)_ value. **Remarks:** 1. Nowadays lots of screens are at least HD, I believe we have enough space to easily add these two columns to the view without affecting readability. 2. Importance could also be put on the _&quot;Remaining amount to take&quot;_ as this is what we would probably be comparing the full amount with. ### Use case In some of the views of various accounting programs, the importance is sometimes put on VAT free amounts. For the person in charge of manually entering payments into Dolibarr it can be useful to also see VAT free and VAT amounts in order to pinpoint the correct payment information. The objectif is to reduce human error and improve quality of life for the user. ### Suggested implementation Cf. screenshot above ### Suggested steps _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
