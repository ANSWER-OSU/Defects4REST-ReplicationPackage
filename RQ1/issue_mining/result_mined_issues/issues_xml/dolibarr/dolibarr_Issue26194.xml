  <TITLE>Advanced Stock Transfer: Adding a line causes an HTTP ERROR 500</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Bug I would like to transfer some items from one warehouse to another one. I am using the experimental Module `Advanced Stock Transfer `. As soon as I have inserted the desired quantity and click add line, I am getting an HTTP 500 error. ### Environment Version 18.0.2 ### Environment OS Ubuntu 23.04 ### Environment Web server Apache/2.4.55 (Ubuntu) ### Environment PHP PHP 8.1.12-1ubuntu4.3 ### Environment Database MariaDB 1:11.1.2+maria~ubu2204 ### Environment URL(s) /dolibarr/product/stock/stocktransfer/stocktransfer_card.php?id=2#addline ### Expected and actual behavior 1. In `Products` under `Advanced Stock Transfer` click on `New stock transfer` 2. Fill out the `Label` and select an existing `Project` as well as the Warehouses `Entrepôt source` and `Entrepôt de destination` 3. A new window opens. Insert the desired `Qty ` you want to move and click `Add` 4. The line with the desired quantity will be added to the `Advanced Stock Transfer` and continue adding further items. ### Steps to reproduce the behavior 1. In `Products` under `Advanced Stock Transfer` click on `New stock transfer` 2. Fill out the `Label` and select an existing `Project` as well as the Warehouses `Entrepôt source` and `Entrepôt de destination` 3. A new window opens.
