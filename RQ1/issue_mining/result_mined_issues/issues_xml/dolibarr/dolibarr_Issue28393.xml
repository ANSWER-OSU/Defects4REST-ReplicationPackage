  <TITLE>Establish a single entry point</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Feature Request Establishing a single entry point in htdocs/index.php would go a long way toward simplifying function calls, application routing, and improving security. ### Use case It is very simple to add two GET variables to the url indicating the path and name of the file that has to be executed as the first approximation to a single entry point. As a direct improvement, the calls to each controller would already have all the libraries loaded instead of having to load them in each call, and in addition, we would have a constant with the input path without having to define it in the configuration, since it would be the __DIR__ of index.php ### Suggested implementation The modification so that GET variables are accepted is already implemented. The only thing that would have to be done is to modify the call menus so that they call the main index.php with said variables, and in the controllers not to call again what has already been invoked. ### Suggested steps The steps to follow would be: - First, modify the index.php so that it checks if the GET variables exist, and if so, redirect the call to the corresponding controller. - Secondly, modify each controller so that it considers that the calls to the standard libraries are already loaded if it is invoked from index.php - Modify the menus so that they invoke index.php with the GET variables instead of the direct URL.</DESCRIPTION>
