  <TITLE>FIX Third party should get notification upon first ticket creation by email collector class</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Feature Request Dolibarr has a other setup key, **TICKET_CHECK_NOTIFY_THIRDPARTY_AT_CREATION**. Upon setting the value **1** to this key, third party gets notification on new ticket creation by Dolibarr users. But when tickets are created first time with the help of **Email Collector Class**, this doesn't happen. ### Use case _No response_ ### Suggested implementation When a third party sends an email to the mailbox of the Email Collector Class, emaill collector class will collect email and creates a ticket. Now if the vale of the key **TICKET_CHECK_NOTIFY_THIRDPARTY_AT_CREATION** is _**1,**_ then third party should get an confirmation email about the new ticket creation. ### Suggested steps _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
