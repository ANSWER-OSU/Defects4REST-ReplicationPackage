  <TITLE>member type field too narrow</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Bug Both when creating a new member and when editing an existing member the member type field is too narrow to really see the full contents, meaning if you have several member types and they only differ towards the end, then a quick glance can not tell you which type of membership is selected, you have to click on it and activate the dropdown menu. ### Dolibarr Version 19.0.0 + 18.0.4 ### Environment PHP 8.2.7 ### Environment Database 11.3.2-MariaDB-1:11.3.2+maria~ubu2204 ### Steps to reproduce the behavior and expected behavior create 2 or more membership types with very similar length, but only the end characters differ create a member, notice have you have to click through to see which membership type is actually selected. ### Attached files ![member_types](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/assets/2551481/8b7ee1ff-dac8-452c-b61a-81556cfcb54a) ![member_create](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/assets/2551481/4306392c-2a27-446a-be0c-d6516ddabe0a) ![member_type_field_narrow](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/assets/2551481/6dd40821-775a-43e8-88a1-8447715566c3)</DESCRIPTION>
