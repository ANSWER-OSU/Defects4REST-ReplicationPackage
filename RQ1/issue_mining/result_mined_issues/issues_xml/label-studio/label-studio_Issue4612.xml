  <TITLE>Offline access for tagging sensitive data</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Apologies for my lack of expertise in this matter. I am interested in using Label Studio to annotate sensitive data privately. After installing Label Studio on our local machine, I noticed that it requires an internet connection for authentication and continuously sends data to the labelstud.io server. I'm concerned about the security of our private data and want to ensure that it does not get leaked to the internet during this process. I would like to know if it is possible to run a fully private instance of Label Studio that operates self-contained without any internet connection. Any insights or guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!</DESCRIPTION>
