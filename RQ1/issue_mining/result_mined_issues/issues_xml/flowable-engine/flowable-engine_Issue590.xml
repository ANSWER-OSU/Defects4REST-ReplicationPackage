  <TITLE>Task UI fails to start due to NPE in cmmnRepositoryService factory method</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Deploying the Task UI fails due to a `BeanCreationException` for `cmmnRepositoryService`, caused by an NPE in its factory at `org.flowable.app.conf.FlowableEngineConfiguration.cmmnRepositoryService(FlowableEngineConfiguration.java:282)` in `flowable-ui-task-conf`. This seems to be due to the `CmmnEngineConfigurator` not being in the list of configurators added to the `ProcessEngineConfiguration` defined in that class. When adding it in analogous fashion to the `DmnEngineConfigurator` (including adding interface `CmmnEngineConfigurationApi` onto `CmmEngineConfiguration` which already implements the interface methods), the problem disappears. I will submit a PR. Note: the same may need to be done in the `FlowableEngineConfiguration` class in the `flowable-app-rest`.</DESCRIPTION>
