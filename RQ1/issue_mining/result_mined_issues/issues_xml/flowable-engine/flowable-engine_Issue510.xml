  <TITLE>Content REST API in flowable-task does not have a MultipartResolver bean defined</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I was trying to use the content API to upload a file to the content-engine in the flowable-task app - using `POST /content-service/content-items`. I sent a valid multipart/form-data HTTP request from the browser, however on the server it was not converted to a MultipartResolver in the controller in `org.flowable.rest.content.service.api.content.ContentItemCollectionResource#createContentItem(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)`. Instead the body is treated as JSON and the parsing of it fails. This means I cannot upload a file using this resource. The problem is that the content API does not have a `MultipartResolver` bean defined in the flowable-task Spring context. In the flowable-ui-task-conf the `MultipartResolver` is defined in `BaseDispatcherServletConfiguration` but the `ContentDispatcherServletConfiguration` does not inherit from this. Only the process API `ProcessDispatcherServletConfiguration` does. The Form and DMN APIs also have the same configuration - in `DmnDispatcherServletConfiguration` and `FormDispatcherServletConfiguration` - so can potentially have a similar problem. I have not tested this. A workaround is to add a `MultipartResolver` bean to the Content APIs Spring context in my own code. (by adding on the Component scanned path). I am using flowable-6.1.0.</DESCRIPTION>
