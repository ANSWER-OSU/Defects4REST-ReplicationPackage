  <TITLE>Allow VirtualMachine and Device filter by IP address from Primary IP</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### NetBox version v4.2.6 ### Feature type New functionality ### Proposed functionality Add `primary_ip4` and `primary_ip6` filters to `ipam.filtersets.PrimaryIPFilterSet` ### Use case In our use cases we need to get virtual machine or device by their primary IP. Now we do this in two requests: 1. find IP address id by `api/ipam/ip-addresses/?address=1.1.1.1/32` 2. find device or VM by filtering `api/dcim/devices/?primary_ip4_id=&lt;ip_id&gt;` I propose to add filtering by IP address directly, so users can do it only in one request: `api/dcim/devices/?primary_ip4=1.1.1.1/32`. This will decrease the number of requests and time to complete. If the issue is accepted, I would be glad to submit a PR. ### Database changes None ### External dependencies None</DESCRIPTION>
