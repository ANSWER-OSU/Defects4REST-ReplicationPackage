  <TITLE>Add prefix filtering by assigned VLAN group</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### NetBox version v4.2.4 ### Feature type New functionality ### Proposed functionality Please make it possible to use both `Quick search` and `Filter` to be able to properly filter out prefixes by specific `VLAN Groups` they are assigned to. Currently it's possible to only sort the table (asc/desc) by that property, but filtering isn't avaible. ### Use case Having many networks, prefixes and vlans across multiple sites, it would be very helpful to be able to use a proper `filter` and `quick search` to be able to filter for prefixes assigned to specific `vlan groups`. Right now the only way to do so is to have the prefixes page show 1000 entries and use the browser's search tool to highlight specific vlan groups. ### Database changes _No response_ ### External dependencies _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
