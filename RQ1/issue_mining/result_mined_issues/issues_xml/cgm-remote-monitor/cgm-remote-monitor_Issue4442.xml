  <TITLE>Basal plugin erroneously required for Profile Editor link</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>When the `basal` plugin is not included in `ENABLE`, the &quot;Profile Editor&quot; link does not appear in the main NS menu. This should not be the case. ![screen shot 2019-03-04 at 10 24 18 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/801582/53754121-d9509000-3e67-11e9-8138-0b2b234cc6f9.png) Have tested on three different sites running 0.11.1 (although I think this behaviour predates 0.11, as I've seen the symptom earlier — just never tied it to a direct cause until now).</DESCRIPTION>
