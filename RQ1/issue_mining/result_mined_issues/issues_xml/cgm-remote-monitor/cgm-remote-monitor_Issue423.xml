  <TITLE>test #2 is flaky</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Travis often fails when running test #2. Example [here](https://travis-ci.org/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor/jobs/50449625#L369). Interestingly, running the same test in succession can produce inconsistent results. In [this commit](https://github.com/dduugg/cgm-remote-monitor/commit/7c31f0def8dadfe5315b21d9b9559cc97bb7e2ea), I duplicated the flaky test (compare lines 30-39 with lines 41-50). Travis [failed](https://travis-ci.org/dduugg/cgm-remote-monitor/jobs/51033835#L397) the first test but [passed](https://travis-ci.org/dduugg/cgm-remote-monitor/jobs/51033835#L457) the second.</DESCRIPTION>

    <COMMIT>
      <MESSAGE>create all docs before calling back Resolves #423. Also changes the callback signature, invoking it with the error and docs, rather than the error, totalCreated, and docs. The third paramter isn't used, and the second parameter should be an array. (Since totalCreated was 0 on callback, it was falsy and replaced with an empty array when used in format_entries.)</MESSAGE>
