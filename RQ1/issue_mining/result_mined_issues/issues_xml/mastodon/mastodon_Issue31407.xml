  <TITLE>No line below follow notifications?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Steps to reproduce the problem - Get followed - Enter &quot;all&quot; tab ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d99d0611-38a2-47e9-89e8-e0cab83127a0) Every notification type has a line above it and below it… *except* a follow notification. ### Expected behaviour Line should appear between follow notification and mention ### Actual behaviour Line visible above follow notification but not below ### Detailed description It just looks weird is all. I don't think I've noticed this before so maybe it's new. I was messing with my notification filters right before I saw this for the first time, so if this isn't usual, maybe something I did triggered it. If you are intentionally doing a thing where you draw no lines between follow notifications when two follow notifications are in a row, that sounds fine to me, but there should be lines between follow notifications and other notification types or it looks inconsistent. Saw on v4.3.0-nightly.2024-08-12, mastodon.social, BOTH advanced and non-advanced mode, BOTH Chrome and Firefox, uBlock Origin is ON, Stylus is OFF.</DESCRIPTION>
