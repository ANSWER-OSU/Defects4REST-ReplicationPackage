  <TITLE>CW appears open in Home timeline and can't be closed</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Steps to reproduce the problem 1. CW posts aren't configured to automatically open 2. A CW'd post appears opened in the Home timeline either way 3. You can't close it ### Expected behaviour CW'd post appears closed and can be opened and closed ### Actual behaviour It appears opened and can't be closed ### Detailed description It only happens in the **Home** column. When looking at the toot in a page or other column, the button works just fine, and the post isn't automatically open. If the same toot is open in the Home timeline and in another column (like the user profile column in the example bellow), the CW opens and closes in the other column but not in the Home timeline.
