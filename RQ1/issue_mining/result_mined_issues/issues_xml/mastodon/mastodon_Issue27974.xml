  <TITLE>Steps descriptions in the welcome page are cut off if the column width isn’t enough</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Steps to reproduce the problem 1. Optionally switch to a language that has relatively long description lines (I saw Japanese). 2. Go to the “You’ve made it” page (URL path /start). 3. Reduce browser width so the main column is narrow. 4. See the steps description lines (e.g. “Boost your interactions by having...”). ### Expected behaviour Description text wraps and takes up two or more lines if the width is not enough. ### Actual behaviour The latter part of description lines are ellipsized and there is no way to read the entire text. ### Detailed description Ellipsis is OK only when the text is an excerpt of what you will get after a click, but these descriptions are supposed to be read right here, so it doesn’t make sense to be cut off. Removing `white-space: nowrap` (and optionally other related rules) from the stylesheet will fix this. ### Mastodon instance mofu.kemo.no with the custom CSS disabled ### Mastodon version v4.2.1 ### Browser name and version Google Chrome 116.0.5845.187 ### Operating system macOS 10.13.6 ### Technical details _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
