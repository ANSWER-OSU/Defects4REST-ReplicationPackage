  <TITLE>All Push Notifications in English</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Steps to reproduce the problem 1. Using Mastodon Social instance. 2. Device and Instance both set in Spanish 3. The official app has been sending all push notifications in English and not Spanish as usual (since five days). ... ### Expected behaviour All push notifications (phone notifications) should be in Spanish as usual ### Actual behaviour All push notifications (phone notifications) are being all received in English since five days. ### Detailed description About five days ago push notifications (phone notifications) (using Mastodon official app) are all being received in English. If instance and device are both set in Spanish, and if it has never been any issue, that means that something weird should be happening on someone's side. It's good to say that this is an issue with mastodon.social . It's not that way to other instances. ### Mastodon instance mastodon.social ### Mastodon version The latest version ### Browser name and version Chrome for Android last Playstore versión. ### Operating system Android 11 ### Technical details It's been happening using Mastodon Official app for Android.
