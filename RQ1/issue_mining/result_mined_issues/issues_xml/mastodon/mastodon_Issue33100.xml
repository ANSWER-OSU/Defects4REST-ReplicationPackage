  <TITLE>Aggressive new tab opening when scroll-clicking in Mastodon suddenly</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Steps to reproduce the problem I have a laptop and a Windows PC with a mouse. When I use the mouse, because of my RSI I scroll by clicking down the middle mouse button to enter &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eec01268-15dc-479a-9443-de25bde7dcdf&quot; width=24&gt; scroll mode. Unfortunately click with middle mouse also is the verb in a web browser for &quot;open new link&quot;. I just spent a month (oct 27 - nov 27) traveling during which time I used only my laptop. When I came back I noticed a slight difference in Mastodon's Advanced Interface. I think something changed. Now if I click almost anywhere to scroll, it opens a new mastodon tab. Since scroll is a frequent action, this means as I use Mastodon many clone tabs pile up unless I am very careful to click on the margins of posts. I see this in both Firefox and Chrome so I think the change must have been in Mastodon. ### Expected behaviour Scroll ### Actual behaviour New Window ### Detailed description It might be this is just a byproduct of improvements on the &quot;click to focus on this post&quot; hitboxes in Advanced Mode and there is nothing you can do about this, but I haven't seen this behavior before today. ### Mastodon instance mastodon.social ### Mastodon version v4.4.0-nightly.2024-11-27 ### Browser name and version Chrome 131.0.6778.86 64bit ### Operating system Windows 10 ### Technical details _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
