  <TITLE>Show profile cards on hover of profiles in &quot;who to follow&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Pitch Profile cards are great, &quot;who to follow&quot; suggestions are great, but the cards don't display when you hover on the &quot;who to follow&quot; suggestions. Can we add them? Same goes for suggested profiles in Explore, on (example link) https://example.org/explore/suggestions. ### Motivation It makes me more likely to follow someone without having to click through to their profile.</DESCRIPTION>
