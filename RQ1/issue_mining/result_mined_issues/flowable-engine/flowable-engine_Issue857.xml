  <TITLE>ACT_GE_PROPERTY: schema.history gets bigger than 300 chars</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We are a long term user of activity/flowable. In the ACT_GE_PROPERTY Table the schema.history is expanded by each upgrade. Our schema.history is now bigger than the 300 chars and we are getting truncate (MS SQL) errors, failing upgrading to the newest version. After removing some history entries, the upgrade went fine. A remove strategy for very old schema.histories should be implemented.</DESCRIPTION>
