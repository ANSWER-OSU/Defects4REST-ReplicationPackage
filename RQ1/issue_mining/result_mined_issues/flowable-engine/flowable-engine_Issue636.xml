  <TITLE>Month always bumps by one in date picker</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The date picker on any form increases the month by one each time it is opened. To test, create a simple process with a start event and user task. Attach a form with just a date field to both the start event and user task. Start the process and enter a date, complete task. When the form opens in the user task, the month has increased by one. This is on plain out-of-the-box 6.2.0.</DESCRIPTION>
