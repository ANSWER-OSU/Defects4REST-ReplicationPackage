  <TITLE>flowable-rest WAR application not working with version 10 of Apache Tomcat</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** Trying to deploy the flowable-rest app using the [documentation](https://flowable.com/open-source/docs/bpmn/ch02-GettingStarted/#getting-started-with-the-flowable-rest-api) and version 10 of Tomcat does not work. All API requests end up with 404 errors: `The origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists.` When launching the Tomcat instance, the flowable-rest app does not seem to be loaded correctly, as the only console output is : ``` 29-May-2021 12:59:15.076 INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.deployWAR Deploying web application archive [C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 10.0\webapps\flowable-rest.war] 29-May-2021 12:59:18.232 INFO [main] org.apache.jasper.servlet.TldScanner.scanJars At least one JAR was scanned for TLDs yet contained no TLDs. Enable debug logging for this logger for a complete list of JARs that were scanned but no TLDs were found in them. Skipping unneeded JARs during scanning can improve startup time and JSP compilation time. 29-May-2021 12:59:18.343 INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.deployWAR Deployment of web application archive [C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 10.0\webapps\flowable-rest.war] has finished in [3,267] ms ``` No other console output mentioning Flowable is listed. When downgrading from Tomcat 10 to Tomcat 9, everything works correctly. **Expected behavior** Two options: - Clearly mention in the documentation that Tomcat 10 is not supported out-of-the-box for the flowable-rest WAR app - Or make the flowable-rest app work on Tomcat 10 :) **Additional context** Flowable version: Flowable 6.6.0, out-of-the-box config with no change Tomcat version: Apache Tomcat 10.0.6, out-of-the-box install with no change</DESCRIPTION>
