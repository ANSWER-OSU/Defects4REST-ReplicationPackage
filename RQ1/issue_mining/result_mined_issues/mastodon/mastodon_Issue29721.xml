  <TITLE>Add &quot;accept all&quot; / &quot;deny all&quot; options to Filtered Notifications column</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Pitch The new &quot;Filtered Notifications&quot; column (mastodon.social v4.3.0-nightly.2024-03-19) ![image](https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky/assets/277318/3326c07e-ae2b-4eca-be8d-97b2dcd07356) Should have two buttons, probably in a drop down menu like the &quot;gear&quot; other columns have. These two buttons should say &quot;Accept all&quot; and &quot;Deny all&quot; and do what they say. ### Motivation I have a mild case of RSI which becomes significant if I do many repetitive actions over a short time. A computer task which requires me to click many times in a row can cause this to flare up. If I were to use notification filters, &quot;accept all&quot;/&quot;deny all&quot; options would help me in two distinct situations: * **Everything is great.** Either I received many contacts on a viral &quot;toot&quot; overnight, or I left my account unattended for a while and got a lot of traffic in the meantime. * **Everything is terrible.** Someone is harassing me, and to do so they created many sockpuppet accounts. In both these cases, I could have so many items in the &quot;Filtered Notifications&quot; column that clicking the accept/dismiss buttons for each one [would become a burden](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/29723). With &quot;Accept all&quot; / &quot;Deny all&quot; options, I could pick out the handful of good notifications (in the first case) or the handful of dubious notifications (in the second case) and bulk accept/deny the rest.</DESCRIPTION>
