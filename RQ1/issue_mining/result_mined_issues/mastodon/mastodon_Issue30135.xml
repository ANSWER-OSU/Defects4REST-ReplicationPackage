  <TITLE>Sort order on Pending Trending Hashtag moderation page inconsistant</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Steps to reproduce the problem 1. Goto the &quot;pending review&quot; page for trending hashtags (admin/trends/tags?status=pending_review) when there are multiple tags awaiting approval 2. observe what hashtags are on the first page 3. Hit Ctrl+R or your favourite page reload process. 4. observe a completely different set of hashtags. ### Expected behaviour The hashtags for review will always appear in a consistent order ### Actual behaviour The sort order appears random, this is exacerbated when there are multiple pages ### Detailed description I think the above covers it well. The reason this is a specific issue is I have ~800 tags to review and my intended process was to start at the end, allow all the ones I liked on the last page, then I could disallow anything remaining on the last page. However since the contents of the page keep changing it means I can't know which tags on the page I have already discounted and haveto review them all again. ### Mastodon instance mstdn.crmbl.uk ### Mastodon version v4.2.8 ### Browser name and version Vivaldi 6.7.3329.21 (Stable channel) (64-bit) ### Operating system Windows 11 ### Technical details _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
