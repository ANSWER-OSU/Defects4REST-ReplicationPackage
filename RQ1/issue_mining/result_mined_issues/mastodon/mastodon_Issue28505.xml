  <TITLE>When reporting user: blur images in post list</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Pitch In the report user section &quot;Are there any posts that back up this report?&quot; it would be nifty if the images were automatically marked as sensitive, i.e. blurred, regardless of what the user being reported set them as. ### Motivation When reporting someone for posting rule-violating images users might not want to see the rest of the images posted (maybe not even re-see the one being reporting), but there they are. Background: I reported someone for posting his fave porn into the public feed and got shown a bunch more in the report popup :( This might just be annoying when it's porn, but if someone's posting illegal or just gruesome stuff a blurred view in the reporting popup might save the reporter a lot of anxiety.</DESCRIPTION>
