  <TITLE>The onboarding quotas are completely arbitrary</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Steps to reproduce the problem (This is about the prompt introduced in #25267) The prompt pops up when the home feed is not going fast enough. Problem is, I'm subscribed to English speakers - geographically mostly American and European. There is a clear lull hour, about 1pm GMT, when Americans are still sleepy and Europeans just don't post much, so the home feed is stalling. ### Expected behaviour do not show this text for people who already know how to subscribe ### Actual behaviour i see the toast ### Detailed description My account is 6 years old, I'm subscribed to 900+ accounts, I'm perfectly fine catching up with the old posts. And every day, about the same time, I see this piece of condescending foolishness. ![1](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/assets/308627/79ced1fd-6301-45a2-9d5b-a5996a6bd019) ### Mastodon instance icosahedron.website ### Mastodon version v4.2.0 ### Browser name and version Librewolf 118 ### Operating system Arch Linux ### Technical details _No response_</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Consider shown and pending status in explore prompt calculation The explore prompt had been picking between shown and pending statuses when deciding whether to display the explore prompt, which prompts you to follow more people if your timeline is not very busy. Considering just the pending statuses would mean that sometimes, if you had posted something which was now a pending status, that would be filtered out (as the explore prompt calculation filters out our own status) leaving no statuses, and thus show the explore prompt, even if there is plenty of activity in the shown statuses. Instead, we should be considering the first 20 of both the pending and shown statuses for this computation; we need to concatenate the lists. Fixes #27197, fixes #27362</MESSAGE>
