  <TITLE>Keyboard: `x` doesn't always work on &quot;Show anyway&quot; on filtered posts</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Pitch I recently learned of the `x` keyboard binding for opening Content Warning'd posts, but was surprised to find out that this doesn't also work for &quot;Show anyway&quot; on filtered posts. ### Motivation I primarily use keyboard navigation, any need to instead click with mouse is a break to my workflow. The presentation of a Content Warning post and a Show Anyway filtered post is very similar, so it makes sense to use the same keyboard binding to &quot;open up&quot; either of these. The functionality of `o` is different, as it opens up the post in a different column in the &quot;advanced&quot; view. This is particularly significant if you're viewing the post in the middle of a number of custom columns (the &quot;opening&quot; is always in the right most column, causing a lateral shift in the view).</DESCRIPTION>
