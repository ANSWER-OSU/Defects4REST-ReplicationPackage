  <TITLE>Can we get a line above the new &quot;Some replies from other servers are not displayed&quot; message</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Last week y'all were talking about adding a message to the end of comment threads to show replies may be missing. Today I see you did this ![screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad42b33a-f46f-4795-8eab-752edd9af71b) I like this feature, but could we get like… a horizontal line, separating the final user message, from this server status message? My poor easily-baffled neurology wants to group the server status text as part of the post because there is no visual separation between them. But they're unrelated. It is distracting. If you want to indicate that the division between the post and the server message is of a different nature than lines dividing posts, you could make the line less wide than the full content area, or make it a different shade of gray. ### And another thing The visual confusion I feel here is increased by the fact that if you select the final post in a thread, there *is* a line at the end. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6156961d-a8f5-4f0c-aba9-d44c0c2f9ab9) ### Configuration I am seeing this in v4.3.0-nightly.2024-08-12 on mastodon.social in Chrome. I am using Advanced Mode in the above screenshots but I checked and it is the same in Regular Mode</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Add a border above the timeline hint for statuses with replies I tried to do it in pure CSS, but this does not work as the sibling divs do not have a class (they are `&lt;HotKeys&gt;` wrappers). The border is only added when needed. I checked the other places the hint is displayed, and there is already a border here (due to the previous component having it). Fixes #31385</MESSAGE>
