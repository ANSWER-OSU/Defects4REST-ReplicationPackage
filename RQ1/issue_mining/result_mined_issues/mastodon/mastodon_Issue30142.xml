  <TITLE>Appeal interface should display post content when an appeal is opened for review</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Pitch Any content (post, media, or accounts) that is made inaccessible through moderation action should sill be accessible to moderators when an appeal is reviewed. Similarly, if the moderator intervention is overturned then the content should be restored; which is not possible if it's been purged from the system. When intervening with reports, there should be an option to &quot;deny appeal&quot; which would have today's behavior of (near) immediate deletion. However, this should require opt-in so that any appeal can be fully actioned. ### Motivation While there are definitely compliance cases where media should be immediately purged, offending content should generally be accessible for appeal. The moderation team at SFBA requires that a different moderator than the intervening one reviews any appeal. Not having the context for the posts makes this checked workflow much more difficult; since the content is often deleted before the appeal is filed or reviewed. This aggressive deletion pattern makes auditing and reviewing moderation interventions near impossible at times. ![486-622-max](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/assets/6901054/39c77e6b-1538-450c-8fb3-5060fda9b0e1)</DESCRIPTION>
