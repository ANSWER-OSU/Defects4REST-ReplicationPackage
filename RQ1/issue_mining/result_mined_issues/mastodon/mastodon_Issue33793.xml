  <TITLE>Expose URLs of privacy policy and TOS via API</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Pitch Allow 3rd party clients to get the URLs of an instance’s privacy policy, terms of service (if defined), and (maybe?) About page. The `configuration.urls` object in `/api/v2/instance` seems like a reasonable place to put this since it already contains the URL of the instance’s status page. Something like: ```json &quot;configuration&quot;: { &quot;urls&quot;: { &quot;streaming&quot;: &quot;wss://streaming.mastodon.social&quot;, &quot;status&quot;: &quot;https://status.mastodon.social&quot;, &quot;about&quot;: &quot;https://mastodon.social/about&quot;, &quot;privacy_policy&quot;: &quot;https://mastodon.social/privacy-policy&quot;, &quot;tos&quot;: &quot;https://mastodon.social/terms&quot; } … ``` That would allow clients to link to these pages or present them in a web view. The ability to actually get the content via an API endpoint (like we already can for the About page using `api/v1/instance/extended_description`) might also be nice, but isn’t as necessary. ### Motivation Especially for clients that offer account creation, the client must be able to present the instance's privacy policy and terms of service (if present) to the user. Currently, I don’t believe there is a way for the client to obtain these URLs other than hard-coding the relative paths, which will break if they ever change, and requires clients to maintain a list of up-to-date paths for every Mastodon-API-compatible server software.</DESCRIPTION>
