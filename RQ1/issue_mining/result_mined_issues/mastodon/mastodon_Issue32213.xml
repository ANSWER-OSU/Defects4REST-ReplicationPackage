  <TITLE>[Advanced mode] Edited post UI with image, displays atop pre-existing search listing</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Steps to reproduce the problem I saw this today on v4.3.0-nightly.2024-10-01 on firefox 130.0.1 snap version on Ubuntu 24.04. Reproduces across many refreshes. I think this is a regression, I feel like I've done this series of steps before but not seen the problem. Below is a video (due to some sort of bug on my computer, the mouse cursor appears fixed in this video, although it is in fact moving). Steps in video: - Start from a new mastodon.social window. - Do a search (in this search from:mcc, so I get my own posts) - Select a post with an image. It will appear in the rightmost column. - Click ⋯ on the post in the rightmost column and choose &quot;Edit&quot;. - The image from the edited post ONLY appears floating atop the search column. [Screencast from 2024-10-01 17-36-31.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f5eb1b4-ad24-46b7-b002-54939cbce228) ### Expected behaviour Choosing &quot;edit&quot; should dismiss the search column. If choosing edit does not dismiss the search column, the edit pane appearing &quot;behind&quot; the search column and not reappearing until the search column is closed would also be entirely acceptable. ### Actual behaviour Edit UI appears both behind and in front of the search column. ### Detailed description In this video, uBlock Origin is ON and Stylus is OFF. ### Mastodon instance - ### Mastodon version - ### Browser name and version - ### Operating system - ### Technical details -</DESCRIPTION>
