  <TITLE>“Websites allowed to credit you” field has autocorrect enabled</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Steps to reproduce the problem 1. Navigate to Settings &gt; Public Profile &gt; Verification 2. Try to type one or more website addresses into the “Websites allowed to credit you” field ### Expected behaviour it accepts that you’ve typed a website address ### Actual behaviour autocorrect changes what you’ve typed to English words, inserts spaces between “words”, and spellcheck gives you a red underline if you type a domain that isn’t an English word (or whatever the browser language is set to) ### Detailed description Website addresses don’t tend to be spelled correctly or grammatically correct in whatever language someone is browsing in, so autocorrect/autocomplete and spell check are not appropriate here. I shouldn’t have to carefully decline all of my autocorrect suggestions to avoid having the website address be misspelled. ### Mastodon instance mastodon.online, mastodon.gamedev.place ### Mastodon version v4.3.1 ### Browser name and version Safari ### Operating system iPadOS 18.2b3 ### Technical details This field should probably have `autocorrect=“off”`, `autocomplete=“off”`, `autocapitalize=“none”`, and `spellcheck=“false”`. Or better yet, instead of one textarea for entering multiple URLs, use multiple `&lt;input type=“url”&gt;` elements so the browser can do the correct thing on its own and also show a more appropriate keyboard.</DESCRIPTION>
