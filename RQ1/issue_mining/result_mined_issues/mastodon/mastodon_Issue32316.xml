  <TITLE>Advanced web interface is slightly too wide for common screen resolution (1080p)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Pitch When using the advanced web interface with five columns – e.g. compose / search (the “drawer”, IIUC?), home, notifications, local timeline, and focused post / getting started – the resulting interface is 1950px wide, which is just slightly more than the 1920px width you get with some common screen resolutions (1920x1080, or 3840x2160 at 200% zoom). I think it would be reasonable to reduce the width a bit, e.g. by shaving 30px off the first column: ```css .drawer { max-width: 320px; /* instead of 350px; .column has 400px btw */ } ``` ### Motivation This would avoid a distracting horizontal scrollbar (and visual truncation at the right edge) for users using a common screen resolution.</DESCRIPTION>
