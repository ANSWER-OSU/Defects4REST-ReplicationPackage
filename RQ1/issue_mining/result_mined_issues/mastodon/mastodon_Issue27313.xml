  <TITLE>Clicking on a thread post leads to the top of the thread</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Steps to reproduce the problem 1. On your timeline, click on a post deep in a thread (or a reply deep enough) 2. See that it loads the thread, scrolled to the reply 3. Press &quot;back&quot; 4. Click again on the same post ### Expected behaviour I see the post I clicked in the thread ### Actual behaviour The thread load, but scrolled to top ### Detailed description _No response_ ### Mastodon instance oisaur.com ### Mastodon version v4.2.0 ### Browser name and version Safari ### Operating system macOS ### Technical details This probably happens when the thread is already loaded in Redux, and `scrollIntoView` is not called somehow.</DESCRIPTION>
