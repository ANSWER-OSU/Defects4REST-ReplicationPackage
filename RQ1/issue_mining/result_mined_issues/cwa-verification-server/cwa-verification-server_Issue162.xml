  <TITLE>Old io.jsonwebtoken Maven dependency</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- Thanks for submitting your question! Before opening a new issue, please make sure that we do not have any duplicates already open. You can ensure this by searching the issue list for this repository. If there is a duplicate, please close your issue and add a comment to the existing issue instead. Also, please, have a look at our FAQs and existing questions before opening a new question. --&gt; ## Why do you use old io.jsonwebtoken maven repo &lt;!-- Include details about your question. --&gt; The developers of this Java Package provided an instruction on GitHub where they explained for installation you have to add &quot;jjwt-api&quot;, &quot;jjwt-impl&quot; and &quot;jjwt-jackson&quot; or &quot;...-gson&quot; to your pom.xml because these are updated. And the repo which is used in this repo(&quot;jjwt&quot;) is very old since 2018 it hasn't been updated. I recommend using the new packages. ... but it could be that it makes no sense for you to use the new repos due to the compatibility with your project which is why I did not create a pull-request. * Source File: pom.xml * Line(s): 139-143 * Question: Why do you use old io.jsonwebtoken maven repo?</DESCRIPTION>
