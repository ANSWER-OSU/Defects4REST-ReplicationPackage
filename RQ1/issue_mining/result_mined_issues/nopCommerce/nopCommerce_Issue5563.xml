  <TITLE>SkiaSharp - Images don't resize when using the supplied Dockerfile</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.40.1 Steps to reproduce the problem: Create a Docker image using the Dockerfile supplied with NopCommerce 4.40 / 4.40.1 An Alpine runtime image is produced. Images do not resize when uploaded as SkiaSharp requires library ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 which is not present. See [https://www.nopcommerce.com/en/boards/topic/90532/image-resize-not-working-on-alpine-since-upgrade-to-nopcommerce-44#283404](https://www.nopcommerce.com/en/boards/topic/90532/image-resize-not-working-on-alpine-since-upgrade-to-nopcommerce-44#283404) for solution/workaround. There may be a better way to do this - I'm surprised that there is nothing in the SkiaSharp documentation that I can find as the latest preview release states that is supports Alpine x64 (I tried the preview before using the workaround and had the same problem).</DESCRIPTION>
