  <TITLE>OOB Email Templates Address Line 2 missing</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.1 Steps to reproduce the problem: Place an order, review emails sent to customer and store owner. Address line 2 is missing in templates. This has caused unnecessary admin/customer enquiries &quot;can I update the address on the order please? etc.&quot; I know it can easily be edited in template, but store owners may miss this on a new store, so would be better to correct out-of-the-box.</DESCRIPTION>
