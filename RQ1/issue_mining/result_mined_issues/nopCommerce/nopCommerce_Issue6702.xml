  <TITLE>Add customer name to order list view in admin</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Let's display customer names on the order list page in admin section. There are just email addresses in it now, and it makes it hard to find the order you are looking for. It should be displayed (and properly encoded) in the same &quot;Customer&quot; column. Dispaly names on the first row, and then email below. See PR - https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/pull/6706</DESCRIPTION>
