  <TITLE>Decide what to do when wrong plugin directory is uploaded</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>When &quot;mainPluginFile&quot; is null in \Nop.Core\Plugins\PluginManager.cs, then exception is thrown. For example, it could happen when &quot;Source code&quot; version of a plugin is upload instead of the compiled one. Let's think what we should better do. Ignore such plugins? Something else? Ideas? Previously a store owner usesd FTP only. So he could easily delete a wrong directory. But now when we support uploading in admin area, it could be a problem for some store owners</DESCRIPTION>
