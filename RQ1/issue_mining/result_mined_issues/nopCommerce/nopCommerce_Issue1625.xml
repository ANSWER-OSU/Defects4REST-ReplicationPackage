  <TITLE>Customer Product Reviews page needs some fixes</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>we discovered 2 problems on the new Customer Product Reviews page. The first is that the new per-page class name added to the html tag is missing for this page. The second problem is that the &quot;active&quot; class name (which is applied to the links inside the customer navigation depending on which page is currently active) is not properly applied for this page - it is being applied to the &quot;customer info&quot; link, instead of the &quot;customer product reviews&quot; link. Also there is an improvement that can be done in the markup for this page. Since the review items and the pager are semantically different, but currently they are not separated, it will be good to have some wrapping element that separates the review items from the pager, like this: &lt;div class=&quot;product-review-list&quot;&gt; ... items ... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;pager&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; Source: http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/43446/suggestion-the-new-customer-product-reviews-page-needs-some-fixes.aspx</DESCRIPTION>
