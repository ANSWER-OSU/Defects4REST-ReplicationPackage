  <TITLE>Incorrect search of orders in the admin area when filter by a warehouse</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.30 &gt; When doing a search on the Order screen, and only selecting a particular warehouse (leaving all other options as blank or ALL), the correct orders are not displayed. In most cases, a negative dollar amount is shown in the total, and no orders are in the grid. Introduced in [this commit](https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/commit/f021d40d4f8fe2a08e53e00beadfb67f17feb000#diff-841ecc872010bdbfcac101a62fb8025b9f4ae9f2dbf814a50c350ac60cf346c4L192), we shouldn't use the `inner join` to `_productWarehouseInventoryRepository` here, since it leads to incorrect results.
