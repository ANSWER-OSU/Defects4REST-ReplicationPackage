  <TITLE>Profit calculation does not take into account payment fees (make configurable)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Is there a way to reduce payment fees from Profit? Example (assume a product cost of $0): How it works currently: Order subtotal $73.90 excl tax Order shipping $0.00 excl tax Payment method additional fee $2.48 excl tax Order tax $6.10 Order total $82.48 Profit $76.38 - NOTE: This is subtotal + fee How it should work since Payment fees are not profit: Order subtotal $73.90 excl tax Order shipping $0.00 excl tax Payment method additional fee $2.48 excl tax Order tax $6.10 Order total $82.48 Profit $73.90 - NOTE: Only subtotal should be profit Source: https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/49084/profit-calculation-does-not-take-into-account-payment-fees.aspx Make configurable (but don'r move this setting to UI)</DESCRIPTION>
