  <TITLE>Possible incorrect count of low stock products</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.30 Hello it seems that you have re-written the GetLowStockProductCombinations, but you forgot to put some (). In terms of .net code the stuff is ok, but since it;s translated to sql it's bad. Put some () for the || conditions or it will return all products :) In sql it's translated to this `(([pac].[StockQuantity] &lt; [pac].[NotifyAdminForQuantityBelow] AND [p].[ManageInventoryMethodId] = 2 AND 1 &lt;&gt; [p].[Deleted] AND [p].[ProductTypeId] &lt;&gt; 10 OR [p].[VendorId] = @vendorId) OR [p].[Published] IS NULL) ` Corrected below: ``` var combinations = from pac in _productAttributeCombinationRepository.Table join p in _productRepository.Table on pac.ProductId equals p.Id where //filter by combinations with stock quantity less than the minimum pac.StockQuantity &lt; pac.NotifyAdminForQuantityBelow &amp;&amp; //filter by products with tracking inventory by attributes p.ManageInventoryMethodId == (int)ManageInventoryMethod.ManageStockByAttributes &amp;&amp; //ignore deleted products !p.Deleted &amp;&amp; //ignore grouped products p.ProductTypeId != (int)ProductType.GroupedProduct &amp;&amp; //filter by vendor ((vendorId ?? 0) == 0 || p.VendorId == vendorId) &amp;&amp; //whether to load published products only (loadPublishedOnly == null || p.Published == loadPublishedOnly) orderby pac.ProductId, pac.Id select pac; ``` Let's check it.
