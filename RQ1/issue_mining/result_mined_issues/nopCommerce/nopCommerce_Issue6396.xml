  <TITLE>Rename a locale</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.50.4 In the software, I found what seems to be an old reference to something called &quot;Manage Stock&quot;, but I think it refers to what is now called &quot;Inventory method&quot;. It is found within the &quot;Product details&quot; page in the Admin section. Specifically, it is in the roll over message for &quot;Minimum stock qty&quot; within the &quot;Inventory&quot; section. So let's rename the hint _If you have enabled 'Manage Stock' you can perform a number of different actions when the current stock quantity falls below (reaches) your minimum stock quantity._ to _If you track inventory you can perform a number of different actions when the current stock quantity falls below (reaches) your minimum stock quantity._</DESCRIPTION>
