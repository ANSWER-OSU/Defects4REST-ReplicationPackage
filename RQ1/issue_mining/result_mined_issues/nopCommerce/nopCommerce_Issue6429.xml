  <TITLE>Incorrect currency in gift card notification</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.50 &gt; 1. nopCommerce version: &gt; 4.5 &gt; &gt; 2. Expected behavior: &gt; Purchasing a $10 USD giftcard should show a USD symbol in the gift card email. As this is the value of the giftcard, in the stores primary currency &gt; &gt; 3. Actual behavior &gt; Purchasing a $10 USD giftcard shows the currency symbol of whatever was used to purchase it (for example, £10) &gt; &gt; 4. Steps to reproduce the problem &gt; Change the store's currency to something other than what the giftcard is being sold in, proceed through checkout, then view the giftcard sent out via email &gt; &gt; 5. Any private modifications you made to your nopCommerce &gt; Nothing that would affect this behavior Source: https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/topic/95523/gift-card-emails-show-incorrect-currency-symbols Note: to reproduce the problem enable `ordersettings.activategiftcardsaftercompletingorder` setting and activate a payment method with the immediate capture feature See also: #6258</DESCRIPTION>
