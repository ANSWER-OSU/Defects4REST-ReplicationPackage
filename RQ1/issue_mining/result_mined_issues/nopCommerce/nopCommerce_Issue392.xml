  <TITLE>Multi-vendors. Allow vendors to export orders</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Why are the export options in the admin order list page disabled for vendor users? I guess it is related to the fact that exports should also be filtered per vendor? I do think it would be very useful for vendors to export their (part of the) orders? for example for importing in their own systems etc? http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/22403/multi-vendor-roadmap-lets-discuss.aspx?p=6#92690 note that vendors should see only thier products. and vendor don't have access to all order info (see how it's implemented on the order details page)</DESCRIPTION>
