  <TITLE>Improve Product Details Before/After Pictures widget zones</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We are suggesting an improvement of the placement of two widget zones on product details page. Recently we had several customers notifying us that if they put any content into the &quot;product_details_after_pictures&quot; widget zone, their product page layout is falling apart. It turned out that it is happening because the widget is not placed inside the &quot;gallery&quot; element where the product pictures are, but is placed next to it. In most nopCommerce sites, the &quot;gallery&quot; and &quot;overview&quot; elements are styled as columns, so putting any content between them will cause the page layout to break. Also the &quot;product_details_before_pictures&quot; widget zone (as currently placed before the &quot;gallery&quot; and not inside) is identical to the &quot;product_details_top&quot; widget and is not serving any specific purpose. Can you please move these two widgets inside the &quot;gallery&quot; element in the next nopCommerce version, so they can be used as intended? They should be removed from both single &amp; grouped product templates, and placed in the _ProductDetailsPictures.cshtml file instead, like this: ``` &lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt; @await Component.InvokeAsync(&quot;Widget&quot;, new { widgetZone = PublicWidgetZones.ProductDetailsBeforePictures, additionalData = Model }) ... gallery content... @await Component.InvokeAsync(&quot;Widget&quot;, new { widgetZone = PublicWidgetZones.ProductDetailsAfterPictures, additionalData = Model }) &lt;/div&gt; ``` Source: https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/58321/improve-product-details-beforeafter-pictures-widget-zones.aspx</DESCRIPTION>
