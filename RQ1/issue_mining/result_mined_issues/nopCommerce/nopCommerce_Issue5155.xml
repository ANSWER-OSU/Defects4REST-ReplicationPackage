  <TITLE>Display a warning about uploaded but uninstalled plugins (admin area dashboard)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Currently if there are some uploaded but still uninstalled plugins, then a store owner could miss information that they are available. We already display some warnings related to plugins in admin area dashboard. Let's display information about uninstalled plugins with &quot;SystemWarningLevel.Warning&quot; type. Let's recommend to delete or install them. There's no any sense to keep them uninstalled</DESCRIPTION>
