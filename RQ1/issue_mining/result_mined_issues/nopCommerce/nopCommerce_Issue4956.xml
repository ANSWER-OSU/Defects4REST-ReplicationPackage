  <TITLE>Bestsellers report counts sales incorrectly</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.30 &gt; I started to debug the code, at some point in the past someone added in the Category to the query for the best seller report and [because of that left join](https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/blob/develop/src/Libraries/Nop.Services/Orders/OrderReportService.cs#L368) it will count your sales 1 time for each category that product is in. in my case i had a few of my best sellers in two categories and there for my sales were doubled for them. I would assume that sales for an order item should be counted only once, no matter how many categories that product is in. While I just mention this bug for the best sellers report, it might be a good idea to make sure other reports do not have the same issue. Steps to reproduce the problem: map a product to multiple categories, makes some sales and view the best sellers report.
