  <TITLE>RenderPartialViewToString doesn't find absolute paths</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Starting 4.00 eg: this.RenderPartialViewToString(&quot;~/Plugins/MyPluginPath/Views/Partials/_myPartialView.cshtml&quot;, model); For some reason, razorViewEngine.FindView can't seem to find my view in nop 4.0 specifically. The file certainly exists in the build output folder (/Presentation/Nop.Web/Plugins/MyPlugin/Views/Partials/_myPartialView.cshtml) as it renders properly in a view with: @Html.Partial(&quot;~/Plugins/MyPluginPath/Views/Partials/_myPartialView.cshtml&quot;, model)</DESCRIPTION>
