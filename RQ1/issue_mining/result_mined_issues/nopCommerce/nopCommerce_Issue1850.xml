  <TITLE>Searching by encoded keywords (full description)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>For example, the word &quot;vitlök&quot; is encoded as &quot;vitl&amp; ouml;&quot; (remove space) in the editor on a product details page (Swedish characters). And when you search by &quot;vitlök&quot;, then nothing will be found. Looks like we also have to encode entered keywords - SearchTermAutoComplete and Search. But it's encoded in full description only (not in &quot;short description&quot; or &quot;name&quot;). ticket 12875 from premium support</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>#1850 Ensure that special chars are not encoded (rich editor). For example, ä should NOT become &quot;&amp;auml;&quot;. Otherwise, database searches become impossible when words contain a character of this kind.</MESSAGE>
