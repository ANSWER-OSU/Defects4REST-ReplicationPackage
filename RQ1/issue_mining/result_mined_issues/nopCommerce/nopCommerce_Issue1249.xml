  <TITLE>Issue with carts that don't require shipping but &quot;tax based on&quot; setting is set to &quot;shipping address&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Step to reproduce: 1. Set &quot;tax based on&quot; setting is set to &quot;shipping address&quot; 2. Add some shippable products to the cart and place an order. &quot;ShippingAddress&quot; property of a customer will be set and stored 3. Now add some not shippable products to the cart and start checkout. Tax will be based on a previously entered shipping address. But in this case we should use &quot;Default address&quot; entered on the tax settings page It could reproduced only with one-page checkout. We should fix it by adding the following code to CheckoutController ``` //no shipping address selected _workContext.CurrentCustomer.ShippingAddress = null; _customerService.UpdateCustomer(_workContext.CurrentCustomer); ```</DESCRIPTION>
