  <TITLE>PDF invoice doesn't work for custom currencies (in debug mode)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.60.0 The RTM release appears to have introduced a bug. Unable to print PDF Invoice with custom currency symbol (e.g. INR or RUB). It was working fine in nopCommerce 4.60 (Beta). The issue was introduced in https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/6464. But please note that it doesn't work in &quot;debug&quot; configuration only. It works without any issues in &quot;release&quot; configuration. Anyway, it's better to disable exception even in the &quot;debug&quot; mode as well</DESCRIPTION>
