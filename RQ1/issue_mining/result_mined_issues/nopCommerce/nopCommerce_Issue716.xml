  <TITLE>paypal standard fails when too many products in cart</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>In PayPal.Standard plugin when &quot;pass product names and order totals to PayPal&quot; is enabled and number of titles in shopping car is large (in my case &gt; 40) and/or their titles are long, paypal fails with following error: Bad Request Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand. Reference 7.69341602.1378216923.0 (Above is displayed on PayPal site). The reason is too long URL. We need to shorten product names and/or turn off &quot;pass product names..&quot; option when number of items is too large.</DESCRIPTION>
