  <TITLE>Display both &quot;title&quot; and &quot;system name&quot; for topics (admin area)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Currently we display only system name in admin area &gt; content management &gt; topics. It could be confusing for some store owners because system name is not so friendly as &quot;title&quot;. Furthermore, it could be empty On the other hands we also cannot display only &quot;title&quot; because it's also empty in case cases. For example, for topics such as &quot;ApplyVendor&quot;, &quot;CheckoutAsGuestOrRegister&quot;, &quot;ContactUs&quot;, etc. It does make sense to add the second column for &quot;title&quot; because it'll take a lot of space in the grid. The suggestion is to do the following: 1. Rename the column to &quot;Name&quot; (not &quot;title&quot; or &quot; system name&quot;) 2. If title is not empty, then display it 3. If title is empty, then display the &quot;system name&quot;</DESCRIPTION>
