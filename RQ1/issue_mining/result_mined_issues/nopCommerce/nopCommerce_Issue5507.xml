  <TITLE>Catalog pages without products should not display &quot;No products were found that matched your criteria&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.40 beta Steps to reproduce the problem: When you visit a category without direct products i.e Computers. This message is shown under the images of the subcategories: &quot;No products were found that matched your criteria.&quot; I believe this is needed only after filtration.
