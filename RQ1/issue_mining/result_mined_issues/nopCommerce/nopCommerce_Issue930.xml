  <TITLE>Recurring orders don't support &quot;CustomValues&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, According to me there should be need to add a line of code in the OrderProcessingService.cs For the Recurring Payment as Old Credit information is used, similary old Custom Values should be used. Need to change in the Place Order Method. ``` if (details.IsRecurringShoppingCart) { //Old credit card info //save old Custom values also processPaymentRequest.CustomValues = details.InitialOrder.DeserializeCustomValues(); ``` Reason : Suppose I am using a Payment Method like UsaePay. When I am using a PaymentMethodId of a customer for Order instead of Credit Card. I can fetch it from the Custom Values. --- let's investigate it first</DESCRIPTION>
