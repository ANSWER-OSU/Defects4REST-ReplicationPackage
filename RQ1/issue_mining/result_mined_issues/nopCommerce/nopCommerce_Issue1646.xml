  <TITLE>Estimated Shipping Form. Make zip code required</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I just wanted to suggest that there be some validation elements displayed on the 'Estimate Shipping' form when no ZIP code is submitted. Currently, no errors are shown when the ZIP code input is empty upon submission. All that is displayed is the 'In-Store Pickup' shipping method (estimate). It also seems like the ZIP code should be labelled 'required', as many of the shipping rate calculators seem to use the ZIP to calculate rates.
