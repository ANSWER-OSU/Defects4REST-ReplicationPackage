  <TITLE>UPS. Problem with getting negotiated rates</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>If I have a shipment with more than 1 package UPS is not returning negotiated rates irrespective of the NegotiatedRatesIndicator. RatesAssociatedWithShipperNumber and DailyRates are the same. And RetailRates are lower which is not what I would expect. See details on [this post](https://www.nopcommerce.com/en/boards/topic/101817/ups-47-problem-with-rates#318632)</DESCRIPTION>
