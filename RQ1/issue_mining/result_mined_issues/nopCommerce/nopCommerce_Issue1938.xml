  <TITLE>Problem with pickup point marker position</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>One of our clients reported an issue with wrong points marker position on the map if the pickup points have coordinates. In the default plugin, it is not possible to add coordinates (longitude and latitude) but they are available in the PickupPoint class and you can set them.
