  <TITLE>Impersonate (place order). Allow a store owner to purchase products with &quot;call for price&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I have a vendor that has requested that I not show the price of their product on my site. They sell both wholesale and retail, and have their own retail e-commerce site. I made the changes for their products by selecting the &quot;call for price&quot; checkbox . When I go to Place Order (Impersonate), the products cannot be purchased I would like a feature that would allow the Administrator to see the &quot;price&quot; button when in the impersonate mode. This would allow for the Administrator to complete the purchase via phone or secure chat on the back-end without changing what the customer sees on the front-end. Let's make it configurable. &quot;Allow a store buy products with &quot;call for price&quot; enabled&quot; (enabled by default).
