  <TITLE>Update UK counties</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I recently had to select the &quot;Hereford &amp; Worcester&quot; county (state) in the UK. Please note that the county &quot;Hereford &amp; Worcester&quot; split into two separate counties, &quot;Herefordshire&quot; &amp; &quot;Worcestershire&quot; in 1998. Technically most cities on the UK are not even considered to be in a county, so even selecting &quot;Herefordshire&quot; when my city/town is &quot;Hereford&quot; is incorrect - there should ideally be a blank county to select in the UK, but it's acceptable to select the nearest county. The order succeeded anyway, but I thought I'd let you know that your county list is quite out of date</DESCRIPTION>
