  <TITLE>UPS shipping plugin. Negotiated rates for shipment without StateProvinceFrom</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.60 &gt; Slight problem if trying to use negotiated rates when the shipper is based in a country that does not have an abbreviation for the StateProvinceFrom, like the UK where I am based. This causes the check on line 380 in the UPSService.CreateRateRequestAsync method to not use negotiated rates, as stateCodeFrom is always null Source: https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/topic/98385/ups-rates It seems we could remove condition `!string.IsNullOrEmpty(stateCodeFrom)`</DESCRIPTION>
