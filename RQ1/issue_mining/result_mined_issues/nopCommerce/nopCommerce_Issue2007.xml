  <TITLE>Admin Dashboard Charts - Orders and New Customers showing flat line since 2017</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>For nop v3.80, in the admin dashboard section. I am seeing a flat line for the small graphs &quot;Orders&quot; and &quot;New Customers&quot;. It seems like the change of 2016 to 2017 did not go well on those graphs. I can confirm new customers and new orders on Jan 1 and 2. But they are not represented on the graphs: - Week Graph: Shows 0 (flat line) - incorrect - Month Graph: Shows 0 (flat line) - incorrect - Year Graph: Show correct numbers, including data for January 2017.
