  <TITLE>Number of ways in which an order status could be &quot;COMPLETED&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I tested the order section in many ways and found out that the status of the order remains &quot;Processing&quot; OR &quot;Pending&quot; until and unless the store owner clicks on 4 buttons i.e: 1) Mark as paid 2) Set as shipped 3) Set as delivered 4) Set Tracking Number (i think this is optional) Is this combination of events a feasible way to make the order status as &quot;Completed&quot; ? I think it totally depends on the store owner how they would like the order status to be &quot;Completed&quot; and current 1.8version limits the store owner to go through above mentioned events to make any order as &quot;Completed&quot; Once the store owner provides the tracking number to the customer, it should be the customer's responsibility to check the status of the order online. But currently in 1.8version the store owner also has to follow the delivery status of the product(s) along with the customer because until and unless the store owner &quot;Set the product as Delivered &quot; the order status will remain &quot;Processing&quot;/ &quot; Pending&quot;. It would be great to deal with this situation in 3 ways: 1) The &quot;Set as Delivered&quot; should not be mandatory in making the order status &quot;Completed&quot;. Once the store owner &quot;Mark the order as Paid&quot; and &quot;Set the order as Shipped&quot;. the order should become &quot;Completed&quot;. 2) The procedure/method for store owner to make any order status &quot;Completed&quot; should be make configurable so that store owner could follow his/her own specific pattern of making order status &quot;completed&quot; or set his own events (out of above mentioned button clicks) to make order status &quot;Completed&quot; Source: http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/7475/number-of-ways-in-which-an-order-status-could-be-completed.aspx#30590</DESCRIPTION>
