  <TITLE>Update Facebook plugin description</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I have translated the new facebook resources and tried also out to control that the field names are choosen right. But Facebook has changed completely the forms for developer. Here is a screenshot (german) but you see … its much different than in the description. ![unnamed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5019111/42342747-aae715bc-809f-11e8-8d8a-8c428d3c27b7.jpg) Perhaps someone controls the English page and made an update to your plugin.</DESCRIPTION>
