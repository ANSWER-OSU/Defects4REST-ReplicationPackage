  <TITLE>Problem with conditional checkout attributes that are not visible but required</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The conditional checkout attributes that are not visible but are required should not be validated. The problem can be reproduced the same way as the one we reported before for the regular conditional attributes. See point 3 in this post (http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/38391/suggestions-for-the-upcoming-version-370.aspx#155164) Source: http://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/43858/problem-with-conditional-checkout-attributes-that-are-not-visible-but-required.aspx</DESCRIPTION>
