  <TITLE>Issue with cultures that use a comma as decimal separator</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.50 RC something happened with the regional settings. Danish language uses ,(comma) as decimal seperator and if I select danish language and enters the products in admin i see wrong prices, weight and measures. They are multiplied with 10000. That has never been an issue before. Example price with Danish 12000000,00 DKK but with UK it´s correct 1200.00DKK. Only in admin the display is wrong in storefront it always shows 1200 DKK no matter DA/UK. If i change my regional setting on computer from , to . then it works fine. But somehow there is a problem as this is not right.
