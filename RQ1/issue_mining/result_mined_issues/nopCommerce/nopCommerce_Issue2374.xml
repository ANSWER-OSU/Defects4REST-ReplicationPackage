  <TITLE>Not able to update a specification attribute at the product level if the value of the option is a number or int</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The Problem After adding a specification attribute to a product, you are no longer able to update the attribute at the product level if the value of the option is a number or int. Updating means changing the order, enabling the filter or enabling/disabling to &quot;show on product page&quot;. How I Discovered I recognized a pattern in that when the value of the attribute option is a number or int like 1 or 2 or 3, you are unable to update the option in the product. You will receive an &quot;Error happened&quot; when trying to update. However, when the value is text or a string, there is no issue. How To Reproduce 1. Create a Specification Attribute with an option value of 1 or 2 or 3. 2. Add the Specification Attribute to a product. 3. Try to change the display order from within Product &gt; Specification Attributes. 4. When you receive a &quot;Error Happened&quot; dialog, change the option value which is &quot;Name&quot; in the sql table SpecificationAttributeOption from 1 to A. 5. Now try to update the display order in Product &gt; Specification Attributes. 6. You will notice the attribute option and other values can now be updated. 7. Reverse changes, repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 to confirm failure to update.
