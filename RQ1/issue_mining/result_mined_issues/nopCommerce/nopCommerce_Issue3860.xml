  <TITLE>Language Resource Import no longer supports UTF-8</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.20 beta Steps to reproduce the problem: Under Language, Resources the import did not accept anymore the utf-8 xml files. it gets a read error in the first line (by the way also utf-16 without bom is also not supported, only utf-16LE). yes, we could convert the unicode resource file for 4.20, but we have also translated about 80 plugins which are all utf-8 to be read in all versions of nop commerce. At this momentm we have to offer two files, of all, only because 4.20 could not read utf-8. Is there a chance to accept on import also utf-8 xml?</DESCRIPTION>
