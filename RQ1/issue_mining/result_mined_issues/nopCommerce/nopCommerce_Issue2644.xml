  <TITLE>Move jQuery library to the footer (public store)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We already have other libraries and inline scripts moved to the footer. Should we do it for jQuery? Just ensure that it'll work fine for \Views\Shared\ _CreateOrUpdateAddress.cshtml which has inline script without moving it to the footer. It should be ignored as it's used in AJAX requests on one-page checkout (e.g. billing and shipping address). This file doesn't have head and footer, hence we cannot move it. For example, states won't be loaded on the billing address step during checkout when you change a country Ideas?</DESCRIPTION>
