  <TITLE>Down migrations are not called during plugin uninstallation</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.50 It seems like when uninstalling a plugin with a database table the table is not deleted (Down migrations are not called). You can easily test this with the Avalara plugin for example. After we uninstall the plugin the TaxTransactionLog table is still present.
