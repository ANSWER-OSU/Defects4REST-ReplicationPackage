  <TITLE>Order CustomValuesXml</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: All Regards the attribute order.CustomValuesXml On the Customer Order Details page, the decoded values are associated with and displayed under the Billing Address heading In the Order PDF the values are displayed separately under the Payment Method Details In Admin Order Details the Custom Values are displayed separately under the Payment Method details I use order.CustomValuesXml for storing details about the payment either: The Payment Method type (in the case where there are multiple payment types for the one payment method) For other payment methods order.CustomValuesXml is used to store a Payment Receipt number I dont know how others may use it ? I also do not know if there is a reason why order.CustomValuesXml are associated with the Billing Address on the Customer Order Details page ? This attribute is more likely to be used to store information about the order rather than details related to the billing address. I would like to recommend that the display of the order.CustomValuesXml be moved on the Customer Order Details page to under the Payment Details so that it is standardised in all three locations.</DESCRIPTION>
