  <TITLE>Azure. Invalid mime type saved in blob</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>To verify this, open up any site storing images in azure and add a product image. Then look at the mime type in azure. Its incorect so if a user right clicks and opens a image in the new tab it downloads because the mime type is wrong. Verified with chrome debugger as well. Can you point me to the code that writes the image to the storage container please</DESCRIPTION>
