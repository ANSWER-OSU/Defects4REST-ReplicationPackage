  <TITLE>Support searching of manufacturers and categories (configurable)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Enter any of your manufacturers/category names and search. No results returned. When you enter manufacturers (or category) name in search box you get no results, even tho there are many products by that manufacturer (that category) in the shop. Can this really be by design? Many people search that way and it's weird that it doesn't return a list with all products by that manufacturer, and manufacturer info. Same goes for category search, it should return a list with all products in category, and category info, if there is one. There were some posts about that in forum, and one [hacky solution](https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards/t/43453/adding-manufacturer-search-to-product-search-dboproductloadallpaged.aspx), but I'm sure people would rather have it in by default. As I said, many people search this way, so at least there should be a setting for that (in admin), a pair of checkboxes with something like &quot;search for manufacturer/brand name too&quot;. We can make it configurable where to search by category and manufacturer names (not products in these categories). So let's add new separate settings whether we should search in categories or manufacturers - admin area &gt; configuration &gt; catalog pages &gt; &quot;search&quot; block</DESCRIPTION>
