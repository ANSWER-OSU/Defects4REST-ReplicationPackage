  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.30 Beta Steps to reproduce the problem: Go to customer setting Select **Email validation is required after registration** method as **Registration method** Go to registration page, fill form and submit it. After submit form, it displays below message: **Your registration has been successfully completed. You have just been sent an email containing membership activation instructions.** ![__register](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13154058/78584840-798c9b80-7856-11ea-9724-358ea98f9018.png) Here used membership words instead of registration. Normally membership word uses when registration type paid and it for specific time like 1-month subscription, quarterly or yearly subscription. -------------- [A.M.] Let's update it to &quot;Your registration has been successfully completed. You have just been sent an email containing activation instructions.&quot;</DESCRIPTION>
