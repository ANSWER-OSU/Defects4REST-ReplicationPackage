  <TITLE>Error when using a URL (store) that does not exist. It should throw error with usable errormessage.</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>nopCommerce version: 4.1 Steps to reproduce the problem: If you have a url in the store(settings) that does not exist, you get a 502 error with no real error message. In order to find the real error, you have to debug the solution and get &quot;No such host&quot;. Should there be a seperate URL for development?</DESCRIPTION>
