  <TITLE>podman completely deadlocks when copying to mounted volume</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Description Podman hangs if copying to a container path backed by an existing, non-empty volume. Every other podman invocation will hang too, aslong this operation is stuck. Only terminating the operation is possible. ### Steps to reproduce the issue Steps to reproduce the issue 1. Create some nonemtpy volume 2. Create a container mounting this volume 3. Copy to the container, using the path of the volume Complete reproducer: ``` bash # Preparation mkdir -p /tmp/test echo &quot;text&quot; &gt; /tmp/test/file A=$(podman create --volume build:/builds debian) podman cp /tmp/test/. $A:/builds podman container rm $A # Bug A=$(podman create --volume build:/builds debian) podman cp /tmp/test/. $A:/builds ``` ### Describe the results you received The `cp` operation just hangs indefinitely, aswell as every podman command. For example, aslong as the `cp` operation is not killed, running `podman ps` will block too. ### Describe the results you expected The operation to succeed (or possibly fail). The `podman` &quot;system&quot; not completely blocked. ### podman info output ```yaml host: arch: amd64 buildahVersion: 1.39.0 cgroupControllers: - memory - pids cgroupManager: systemd cgroupVersion: v2 conmon: package: conmon_2.1.12-4_amd64 path: /usr/bin/conmon version: 'conmon version 2.1.12, commit: unknown' cpuUtilization: idlePercent: 94.44 systemPercent: 0.49 userPercent: 5.07 cpus: 32 databaseBackend: sqlite distribution: codename: trixie distribution: debian version: unknown eventLogger: journald freeLocks: 2046 hostname: vienor05-pc idMappings: gidmap: - container_id: 0 host_id: 1000 size: 1 - container_id: 1 host_id: 100000 size: 65536 uidmap: - container_id: 0 host_id: 1000 size: 1 - container_id: 1 host_id: 100000 size: 65536 kernel: 6.12.17-amd64 linkmode: dynamic logDriver: journald memFree: 23845367808 memTotal: 67100073984 networkBackend: netavark networkBackendInfo: backend: netavark dns: package: Unknown package: netavark_1.12.1-9_amd64 path: /usr/lib/podman/netavark version: netavark 1.12.1 ociRuntime: name: crun package: crun_1.20-1_amd64 path: /usr/bin/crun version: |- crun version 1.20 commit: 9c9a76ac11994701dd666c4f0b869ceffb599a66 rundir: /run/user/1000/crun spec: 1.0.0 +SYSTEMD +SELINUX +APPARMOR +CAP +SECCOMP +EBPF +CRIU +WASM:wasmedge +YAJL os: linux pasta: executable: /usr/bin/pasta package: passt_0.0~git20250217.a1e48a0-1_amd64 version: &quot;&quot; remoteSocket: exists: true path: /run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock rootlessNetworkCmd: pasta security: apparmorEnabled: false capabilities: CAP_CHOWN,CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE,CAP_FOWNER,CAP_FSETID,CAP_KILL,CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE,CAP_SETFCAP,CAP_SETGID,CAP_SETPCAP,CAP_SETUID,CAP_SYS_CHROOT rootless: true seccompEnabled: true seccompProfilePath: /usr/share/containers/seccomp.json selinuxEnabled: false serviceIsRemote: false slirp4netns: executable: &quot;&quot; package: &quot;&quot; version: &quot;&quot; swapFree: 1395912704 swapTotal: 2147479552 uptime: 50h 0m 2.00s (Approximately 2.08 days) variant: &quot;&quot; plugins: authorization: null log: - k8s-file - none - passthrough - journald network: - bridge - macvlan - ipvlan volume: - local registries: {} store: configFile: /home/vienor05/.config/containers/storage.conf containerStore: number: 1 paused: 0 running: 0 stopped: 1 graphDriverName: overlay graphOptions: {} graphRoot: /home/vienor05/.local/share/containers/storage graphRootAllocated: 3992179441664 graphRootUsed: 136293740544 graphStatus: Backing Filesystem: btrfs Native Overlay Diff: &quot;true&quot; Supports d_type: &quot;true&quot; Supports shifting: &quot;false&quot; Supports volatile: &quot;true&quot; Using metacopy: &quot;false&quot; imageCopyTmpDir: /var/tmp imageStore: number: 17 runRoot: /run/user/1000/containers transientStore: false volumePath: /home/vienor05/.local/share/containers/storage/volumes version: APIVersion: 5.4.0 Built: 1739713871 BuiltTime: Sun Feb 16 14:51:11 2025 GitCommit: &quot;&quot; GoVersion: go1.24.0 Os: linux OsArch: linux/amd64 Version: 5.4.0 ``` ### Podman in a container No ### Privileged Or Rootless Rootless ### Upstream Latest Release No ### Additional environment details using podman püackage from debian testing/trixie ### Additional information _No response_</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Fix a potential deadlock during `podman cp` Have one function without a `defer lock.unlock()` as one of the commands in it calls a function that also takes the same lock, so the unlock has to happen prior to function completion. Unfortunately, this is prone to errors, like the one here: I missed a case, and we could return without unlocking, causing a deadlock later in the cleanup code as we tried to take the same lock again. Fix is simple enough - add the missing unlock. Fixes #25585 Signed-off-by: Matt Heon &lt;mheon@redhat.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
