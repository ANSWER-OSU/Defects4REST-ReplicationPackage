  <TITLE>podman-tag.1.html contains &quot;&lt;title&gt;NAME &amp;#8212; Podman documentation&lt;/title&gt;&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- --------------------------------------------------- BUG REPORT INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------- Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment: You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST **NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed in more current versions of the project. Before reporting an issue, please verify the version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md). If they differ, please update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating an issue. Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md), please reference that page before opening a new issue. If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs. --&gt; **Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind bug **Description** &lt;!-- Briefly describe the problem you are having in a few paragraphs. --&gt; The title of the web page https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-tag.1.html has changed since 30 July 2022. The word `podman-tag` has been replaced with `NAME`. I would guess that this is unintentional. Currently it looks like this ``` $ date Thu Sep 15 18:47:59 CEST 2022 $ curl -Ls https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-tag.1.html | grep '&lt;title&gt;' &lt;title&gt;NAME &amp;#8212; Podman documentation&lt;/title&gt; ``` Wayback Machine has a version of the same web page from 30 July 2022 ``` $ curl -Ls https://web.archive.org/web/20220730202038/https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-tag.1.html | grep '&lt;title&gt;' &lt;title&gt;podman-tag &amp;#8212; Podman documentation&lt;/title&gt; ``` It seems to be a general problem that is not limited to podman-tag.1.html. I randomly picked two more web pages (podman-run.1.html, podman-create.1.html) and checked. They have the same title as podman-tag.1.html. ``` $ date Thu Sep 15 19:18:42 CEST 2022 $ curl -Ls https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html | grep '&lt;title&gt;' &lt;title&gt;NAME &amp;#8212; Podman documentation&lt;/title&gt; $ curl -Ls https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-create.1.html | grep '&lt;title&gt;' &lt;title&gt;NAME &amp;#8212; Podman documentation&lt;/title&gt; $ ```</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Fix broken titles on readthedocs Followup to #15621, which (correctly) removed parentheses from md files. Turns out, a hidden part of our readthedocs process depended on those parentheses. Update that step so it handles the new, correct, &lt;space&gt;&lt;section-number&gt; format. Also update local-testing documentation in README, and clean it up a little. Fixes: #15822 Signed-off-by: Ed Santiago &lt;santiago@redhat.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
