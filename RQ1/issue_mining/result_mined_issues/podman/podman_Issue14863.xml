  <TITLE>Cirrus: new API clobbers past (flake) runs</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The new logformatter URL mechanism, after #14608, has a serious flaw: flake URLs are lost. Reason: the new URLs include the **BuildID**, and **TaskName**, but not the **TaskID**. TaskID is the crucial one for linking to a flake log. Without TaskID, we have something like `/build/12345/int this that`, but the `int this that` on a successful run clobbers the one of the flaked run. @cevich let's talk about this upon your return please.</DESCRIPTION>
