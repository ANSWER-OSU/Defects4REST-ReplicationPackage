  <TITLE>Second podman run fails to bind to port with `--userns=keep-id` option</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- --------------------------------------------------- BUG REPORT INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------- Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment: You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST **NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed in more current versions of the project. Before reporting an issue, please verify the version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md). If they differ, please update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating an issue. Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md), please reference that page before opening a new issue. If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs. --&gt; **Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind bug **Description** podman connects to port the first time, but the second time can't connect. The port is being held onto by gvproxy. **Steps to reproduce the issue:** I ran on m1 mac the same command twice. It succeeded the first time and failed the second. ``` # podman run --network bridge -p 8008:8008 --rm -ti --privileged --userns=keep-id hello-world &gt; /dev/null # podman run --network bridge -p 8008:8008 --rm -ti --privileged --userns=keep-id hello-world &gt; /dev/null Error: error preparing container b04da0cdeaf862bc32d9aa2a7a11552c39285c36548abd22cbb19047f43d5e26 for attach: something went wrong with the request: &quot;listen tcp :8008: bind: address already in use\n&quot; ``` **Describe the results you received:** ``` Error: error preparing container b04da0cdeaf862bc32d9aa2a7a11552c39285c36548abd22cbb19047f43d5e26 for attach: something went wrong with the request: &quot;listen tcp :8008: bind: address already in use\n&quot; ``` **Describe the results you expected:** ``` ``` **Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):** Symptoms are similar to #13354 ``` # lsof -i tcp:8008 COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME gvproxy 25197 me 16u IPv6 0x35055bd93189a309 0t0 TCP *:http-alt (LISTEN) ``` **Output of `podman version`:** ``` # podman version Client: Podman Engine Version: 4.1.0 API Version: 4.1.0 Go Version: go1.18.1 Built: Thu May 5 14:07:47 2022 OS/Arch: darwin/arm64 Server: Podman Engine Version: 4.0.3 API Version: 4.0.3 Go Version: go1.18 Built: Fri Apr 1 12:22:39 2022 OS/Arch: linux/arm64 ``` **Output of `podman info --debug`:** ``` # podman info --debug host: arch: arm64 buildahVersion: 1.24.3 cgroupControllers: - cpu - io - memory - pids cgroupManager: systemd cgroupVersion: v2 conmon: package: conmon-2.1.0-2.fc36.aarch64 path: /usr/bin/conmon version: 'conmon version 2.1.0, commit: ' cpuUtilization: null cpus: 4 distribution: distribution: fedora variant: coreos version: &quot;36&quot; eventLogger: journald hostname: localhost.localdomain idMappings: gidmap: - container_id: 0 host_id: 1000 size: 1 - container_id: 1 host_id: 100000 size: 1000000 uidmap: - container_id: 0 host_id: 501 size: 1 - container_id: 1 host_id: 100000 size: 1000000 kernel: 5.17.3-300.fc36.aarch64 linkmode: dynamic logDriver: journald memFree: 5756932096 memTotal: 6144200704 networkBackend: netavark ociRuntime: name: crun package: crun-1.4.4-1.fc36.aarch64 path: /usr/bin/crun version: |- crun version 1.4.4 commit: 6521fcc5806f20f6187eb933f9f45130c86da230 spec: 1.0.0 +SYSTEMD +SELINUX +APPARMOR +CAP +SECCOMP +EBPF +CRIU +YAJL os: linux remoteSocket: exists: true path: /run/user/501/podman/podman.sock security: apparmorEnabled: false capabilities: CAP_CHOWN,CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE,CAP_FOWNER,CAP_FSETID,CAP_KILL,CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE,CAP_SETFCAP,CAP_SETGID,CAP_SETPCAP,CAP_SETUID,CAP_SYS_CHROOT rootless: true seccompEnabled: true seccompProfilePath: /usr/share/containers/seccomp.json selinuxEnabled: true serviceIsRemote: true slirp4netns: executable: /usr/bin/slirp4netns package: slirp4netns-1.2.0-0.2.beta.0.fc36.aarch64 version: |- slirp4netns version 1.2.0-beta.0 commit: 477db14a24ff1a3de3a705e51ca2c4c1fe3dda64 libslirp: 4.6.1 SLIRP_CONFIG_VERSION_MAX: 3 libseccomp: 2.5.3 swapFree: 0 swapTotal: 0 uptime: 7m 1.44s plugins: log: - k8s-file - none - passthrough - journald network: - bridge - macvlan volume: - local registries: search: - docker.io store: configFile: /var/home/core/.config/containers/storage.conf containerStore: number: 3 paused: 0 running: 0 stopped: 3 graphDriverName: overlay graphOptions: {} graphRoot: /var/home/core/.local/share/containers/storage graphRootAllocated: 0 graphRootUsed: 0 graphStatus: Backing Filesystem: xfs Native Overlay Diff: &quot;true&quot; Supports d_type: &quot;true&quot; Using metacopy: &quot;false&quot; imageCopyTmpDir: /var/tmp imageStore: number: 69 runRoot: /run/user/501/containers volumePath: /var/home/core/.local/share/containers/storage/volumes version: APIVersion: 4.0.3 Built: 1648837359 BuiltTime: Fri Apr 1 12:22:39 2022 GitCommit: &quot;&quot; GoVersion: go1.18 Os: &quot;&quot; OsArch: linux/arm64 Version: 4.0.3 ``` **Package info (e.g. output of `rpm -q podman` or `apt list podman`):** ``` # brew info podman podman: stable 4.1.0 (bottled), HEAD Tool for managing OCI containers and pods https://podman.io/ /opt/homebrew/Cellar/podman/4.1.0 (174 files, 46.3MB) * Poured from bottle on 2022-05-18 at 09:23:37 From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/podman.rb License: Apache-2.0 ==&gt; Dependencies Build: go ✘, go-md2man ✘ Required: qemu ✘ ==&gt; Options --HEAD Install HEAD version ==&gt; Caveats zsh completions have been installed to: /opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions ==&gt; Analytics install: 21,814 (30 days), 59,279 (90 days), 150,724 (365 days) install-on-request: 21,745 (30 days), 59,202 (90 days), 150,634 (365 days) build-error: 1 (30 days) ``` **Have you tested with the latest version of Podman and have you checked the Podman Troubleshooting Guide?

      <MESSAGE>libpod: store network status when userns is used When a container with a userns is created the network setup is special. Normally the netns is setup before the oci runtime container is created, however with a userns the container is created first and then the network is setup. In the second case we never saved the container state afterwards. Because of it, podman inspect would not show the network info and network teardown will not happen. This worked with local podman because there was a save() call later in the code path which then also saved the network status. But in the podman API code path this save never happened thus all containers started via API had this problem. Fixes #14465 Signed-off-by: Paul Holzinger &lt;pholzing@redhat.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
