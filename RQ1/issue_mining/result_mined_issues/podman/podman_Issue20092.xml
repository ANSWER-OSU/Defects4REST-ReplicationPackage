      <MESSAGE>fixes for pkg/machine/e2e on hyperv some problems were found in machine tests on hyperv. in the case of rootful, it is currently not implemented. an issue #20092 has been created for that problem. there also seems to be a timezone issue between ignition and fcos right now. inquiries are in for that but no issue generated for that. this problem is not exclusive to hyperv by any means. both of the above have been skipped or commented out. otherwise, this fixes machine state reporting for consistency.
