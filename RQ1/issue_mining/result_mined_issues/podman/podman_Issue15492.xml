  <TITLE>Deadlock when container exits while killing by podman</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- --------------------------------------------------- BUG REPORT INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------- Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment: You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST **NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed in more current versions of the project. Before reporting an issue, please verify the version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md). If they differ, please update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating an issue. Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md), please reference that page before opening a new issue. If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs. --&gt; **Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind bug **Description** There is a situation when podman tries to lock the same mutex twice and deadlocks. After that, all podman's commands do not work due to endless waiting for the release of this mutex. There are two possibilities to reproduce this issue - realistic and not. The following steps are about not real but simple way: **Steps to reproduce the issue:** 1. Create a bash script with the following content (be careful - kill command inside): ``` #!/bin/bash set -o errexit podman rm -f -i label-for-kill while true; do podman info &gt; /dev/null podman run --rm --init --name label-for-kill nginx &amp; sleep 3 echo send kill for `pgrep -f label-for-kill` kill `pgrep -f label-for-kill` sleep 3 done ``` 2. Execute the script. **Describe the results you received:** After some time the script will hang. **Describe the results you expected:** The script will never stop and it will do its work. **Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):** The issue happens only occasionally. In my case, it's not reproduced in the adm64 machine, but very often reproduced in my weak ARMv7 device. When issue happens I have the following output: ``` # ./test.sh send kill for 946 1015 /docker-entrypoint.sh: /docker-entrypoint.d/ is not empty, will attempt to perform configuration /docker-entrypoint.sh: Looking for shell scripts in /docker-entrypoint.d/ /docker-entrypoint.sh: Launching /docker-entrypoint.d/10-listen-on-ipv6-by-default.sh send kill for 1270 1337 /docker-entrypoint.sh: /docker-entrypoint.d/ is not empty, will attempt to perform configuration /docker-entrypoint.sh: Looking for shell scripts in /docker-entrypoint.d/ /docker-entrypoint.sh: Launching /docker-entrypoint.d/10-listen-on-ipv6-by-default.sh 2022-08-26T07:53:55.000449985Z: kill container: No such process ``` and the processes list looks like: ``` 1270 S `- podman run --rm --init --name label-for-kill nginx 1356 Z `- [3] &lt;defunct&gt; 1337 S `- /usr/bin/conmon &lt;...&gt; 1355 S `- /usr/bin/podman &lt;...&gt; container cleanup --rm &lt;...&gt; ``` **Output of `podman version`:** ``` Client: Podman Engine Version: 4.3.0-dev API Version: 4.3.0-dev Go Version: go1.17.8 Built: Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 1970 OS/Arch: linux/arm ``` **Output of `podman info`:** ``` host: arch: arm buildahVersion: 1.27.0 cgroupControllers: - cpuset - cpu - cpuacct - blkio - memory - devices - freezer - net_cls - perf_event - net_prio - pids cgroupManager: systemd cgroupVersion: v1 conmon: package: Unknown path: /usr/bin/conmon version: 'conmon version 2.0.29, commit: unknown' cpuUtilization: idlePercent: 87.12 systemPercent: 10.63 userPercent: 2.24 cpus: 4 distribution: distribution: buildroot version: &quot;2022.02&quot; eventLogger: journald hostname: comm99-dev idMappings: gidmap: null uidmap: null kernel: 4.14.98 linkmode: dynamic logDriver: k8s-file memFree: 180031488 memTotal: 511803392 networkBackend: cni ociRuntime: name: crun package: Unknown path: /usr/bin/crun version: |- crun version 1.4.3 commit: 61c9600d1335127eba65632731e2d72bc3f0b9e8 spec: 1.0.0 +SYSTEMD +SELINUX +APPARMOR +CAP +SECCOMP +YAJL os: linux remoteSocket: exists: true path: /run/podman/podman.sock security: apparmorEnabled: false capabilities: CAP_CHOWN,CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE,CAP_FOWNER,CAP_FSETID,CAP_KILL,CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE,CAP_SETFCAP,CAP_SETGID,CAP_SETPCAP,CAP_SETUID,CAP_SYS_CHROOT rootless: false seccompEnabled: true seccompProfilePath: &quot;&quot; selinuxEnabled: false serviceIsRemote: false slirp4netns: executable: &quot;&quot; package: &quot;&quot; version: &quot;&quot; swapFree: 0 swapTotal: 0 uptime: 0h 17m 39.00s plugins: authorization: null log: - k8s-file - none - passthrough - journald network: - bridge - macvlan - ipvlan volume: - local registries: search: - docker.io - registry.fedoraproject.org - registry.access.redhat.com - registry.centos.org store: configFile: /etc/containers/storage.conf containerStore: number: 6 paused: 0 running: 0 stopped: 6 graphDriverName: overlay graphOptions: overlay.mountopt: nodev graphRoot: /opt/containers/storage graphRootAllocated: 29639618560 graphRootUsed: 3874271232 graphStatus: Backing Filesystem: extfs Native Overlay Diff: &quot;true&quot; Supports d_type: &quot;true&quot; Using metacopy: &quot;false&quot; imageCopyTmpDir: /var/tmp imageStore: number: 35 runRoot: /run/containers/storage volumePath: /opt/containers/storage/volumes version: APIVersion: 4.3.0-dev Built: 0 BuiltTime: Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 1970 GitCommit: &quot;&quot; GoVersion: go1.17.8 Os: linux OsArch: linux/arm Version: 4.3.0-dev ``` **Package info (e.g. output of `rpm -q podman` or `apt list podman`):** ``` - ``` **Have you tested with the latest version of Podman and have you checked the Podman Troubleshooting Guide?

      <MESSAGE>libpod: UpdateContainerStatus: do not wait for container Commit 30e7cbccc194 accidentally added a deadlock as Podman was waiting for the exit code to show up when the container transitioned to stopped. Code paths that require the exit code to be written (by the cleanup process) should already be using `(*Container).Wait()` in a deadlock free way. [NO NEW TESTS NEEDED] as I did not manage to a reproducer that would work in CI. Ultimately, it's a race condition.
