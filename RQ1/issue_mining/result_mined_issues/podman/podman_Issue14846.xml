  <TITLE>--pull=newer is undocumented</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- --------------------------------------------------- BUG REPORT INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------- Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment: You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST **NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed in more current versions of the project. Before reporting an issue, please verify the version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md). If they differ, please update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating an issue. Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md), please reference that page before opening a new issue. If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs. --&gt; **Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind feature **Description** There are 3 [options](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html#pull-always-missing-never) for --pull: always, missing, never. In my application I have a preference to check for a new image from the registry if it is available, but a strong requirement that the application has to run without a dependency on the registry, in case it might be unavailable. In my application script I have found myself writing this because there is no other way AFAICT to achieve the desired behaviour: ``` podman pull registry/image ; podman run --pull=never registry/image ``` That doesn't seem right, an option `podman run --pull=try` would be better, with behaviour similar to `always`, but just print a warning if the image was not found in the registry, and still run the image if present locally. ``` try: Pull the image from the first registry it is found in as listed in registries.conf. Print a warning if it is not found in the registries. Then run the image if it is present locally, otherwise raise an error. ``` **Have you tested with the latest version of Podman and have you checked the Podman Troubleshooting Guide? (https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md)** I read the latest documentation for available pulling options.</DESCRIPTION>
