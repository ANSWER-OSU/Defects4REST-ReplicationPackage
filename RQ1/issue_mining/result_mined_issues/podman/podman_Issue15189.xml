  <TITLE>CI: include OSX and windows cross task in CI:DOCS</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- --------------------------------------------------- BUG REPORT INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------- Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment: You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST **NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed in more current versions of the project. Before reporting an issue, please verify the version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md). If they differ, please update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating an issue. Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md), please reference that page before opening a new issue. If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs. --&gt; **Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind bug **Description** https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/15174 broke CI because it used CI:DOCS and thus skipped some tasks. In this case the OCX cross task is now failing. Because the OSX cross task also builds docs, it can be effected by docs changes and therefore we should include this in CI:DOCS. Also excluded is the windows cross task. Since this also builds docs it should be included in CI:DOCS as well.</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Cirrus: Run Cross builds in [CI:DOCS] mode Fixes: #15189 A while ago I updated the only_if/skip options and forgot that several &quot;cross build&quot; tasks also build documentation in addition to binaries. Re-enable them to execute all the time, except when Cirrus-cron is making our multi-arch images. Signed-off-by: Chris Evich &lt;cevich@redhat.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
