  <TITLE>Documentation notes no longer work</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Description I have been following this documentation, https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Introduction.html The command `podman build -t nginx https://git.io/Jf8ol` does not work on my debian-stable system. Some URLs in that file no longer exist. My system, ``` $ podman version Version: 3.0.1 API Version: 3.0.0 Go Version: go1.15.15 Built: Thu Jan 1 01:00:00 1970 OS/Arch: linux/amd64 $ ``` I have also tried a more recent docker file from nginxinc/docker-nginx and this fails with other errors. Newer URL is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx/refs/heads/master/mainline/debian/Dockerfile but this looks like a different issue. ### Steps to reproduce the issue Steps to reproduce the issue 1. Attempt to run podman build -t nginx https://git.io/Jf8ol as shown in doc https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Introduction.html ### Describe the results you received Describe the results you received ### Describe the results you expected Describe the results you expected ### podman info output ```yaml If you are unable to run podman info for any reason, please provide the podman version, operating system and its version and the architecture you are running. ``` ### Podman in a container No ### Privileged Or Rootless None ### Upstream Latest Release Yes ### Additional environment details Additional environment details ### Additional information Additional information like issue happens only occasionally or issue happens with a particular architecture or on a particular setting</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Replace old debian nginx build with alpine A user has reported that a previously used URL in our Introduction documentation is no longer working. It apparently has missing files and so forth. Replaced the old URL with a new one for alpine from the same repository. I intentionally did not shorten the URL because I think seeing the fully namespaced repository is informative to users. Fixes: #25449 Signed-off-by: Brent Baude &lt;bbaude@redhat.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
