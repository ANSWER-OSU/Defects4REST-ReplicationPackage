      <MESSAGE>Makefile: include `release-artifacts` target The current release artifacts generation process is still fairly manual with a bunch of steps. This commit bundles them all into a single convenient Makefile target. The `clean-binaries` target ends up removing `bin/`. So, the artifact dir has been changed to `release/` instead of the current `bin/` to avoid breaking other Makefile targets.
