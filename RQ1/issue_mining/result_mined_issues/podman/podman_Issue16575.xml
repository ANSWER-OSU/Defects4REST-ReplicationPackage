  <TITLE>Request for additional documentation around use of the :z flag on large volumes with many files</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>/kind feature When mounting a large volume containing a large number of files and using the ```:z``` mount flag, ```podman run``` and subsequemtly, other podman commands hang with no reporting to the user. If this is required behaviour, can there be some additional reporting to the user on what is happening under the hood instead of hanging silently. In my case mounting several terabytes of millions of files,the command was hanging for multiple days If anyone is experiencing the same issue, what worked for me was @mheon 's recommendation of removing the ```:z``` flag and using ```--security-opt label=disable``` instead (from #16541 16541)</DESCRIPTION>
