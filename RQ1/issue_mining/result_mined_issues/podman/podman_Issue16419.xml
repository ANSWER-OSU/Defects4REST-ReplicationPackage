  <TITLE>podman generate systemd --restart-sec is not honored by containers</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- --------------------------------------------------- BUG REPORT INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------- Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment: You do NOT have to include this information if this is a FEATURE REQUEST **NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed in more current versions of the project. Before reporting an issue, please verify the version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md). If they differ, please update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating an issue. Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md), please reference that page before opening a new issue. If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs. --&gt; **Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)** /kind bug **Description** &lt;!-- Briefly describe the problem you are having in a few paragraphs. --&gt; `podman generate systemd --restart-sec pod` only generates `RestartSec=` in the pod service, not the container service. This basically renders it ineffective since the containers are the ones likely to be restarting. **Steps to reproduce the issue:** 1. `podman generate systemd --restart-sec 3 my-pod` and inspect the service file of its container **Describe the results you received:** ``` [Service] Environment=PODMAN_SYSTEMD_UNIT=%n Restart=always TimeoutStopSec=90 ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman start my-ctr ExecStop=/usr/bin/podman stop -t 30 my-ctr ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/podman stop -t 30 my-ctr PIDFile=/run/containers/storage/overlay-containers/4b6f4efab716b240ea1f6e65d4f672cb83ec426713fc651f34970eafc0a91e4c/userdata/conmon.pid Type=forking ``` **Describe the results you expected:** Should have `RestartSec=` in there **Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):** **Output of `podman version`:** ``` Client: Podman Engine Version: 4.2.1 API Version: 4.2.1 Go Version: go1.19 Built: Wed Sep 7 19:57:53 2022 OS/Arch: linux/amd64 ``` **Have you tested with the latest version of Podman and have you checked the Podman Troubleshooting Guide? (https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md)** Yes **Additional environment details (AWS, VirtualBox, physical, etc.):**</DESCRIPTION>
