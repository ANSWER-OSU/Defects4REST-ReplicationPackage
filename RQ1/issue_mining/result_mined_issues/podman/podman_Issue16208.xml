  <TITLE>Feature request: support ns namespace path network option for pods</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The option ``` --network ns:[netns-path] ``` where `[netns-path]` is the path of a network namespace to join, is supported when creating containers. But when trying to let a pod to be created the same way (namely to join an existing network pre-defined in the hosting context), it fails: ``` Error: pods presently do not support network mode path ``` My question is: is there future plan to add such a support (for pods)? It will be appreciated to have such a support to increase the networking flexibility of podman ... It is supported for containers why not for pods?</DESCRIPTION>
