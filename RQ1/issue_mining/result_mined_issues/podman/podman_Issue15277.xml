  <TITLE>sdnotify doesn't work on aarch64</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Looks like `socat` never picks up anything on the socket, so sdnotify tests fail. Seeing this right now in @vrothberg's #15248, and we saw it in #14801 (the PR that enabled aarch64 testing) but just did a blanket `skip` because there was so much stuff that was broken. Amid the confusion, I neglected to file an issue for this. Someone will need to `get_ci_vm` to figure out details, but basically, the gist seems to be that `sdnotify` `container` does not work.</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>System tests: reenable some skipped aarch64 tests Background: in order to add aarch64 tests, we had to add emergency skips to a lot of failing tests. No attempt was ever made to understand why they were failing. Fast forward to today, I filed #15888 just to see if tests are still failing. Looks like a number of them are fixed. (Yes, magically). Remove those skips. See: #15074, #15277 Signed-off-by: Ed Santiago &lt;santiago@redhat.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
