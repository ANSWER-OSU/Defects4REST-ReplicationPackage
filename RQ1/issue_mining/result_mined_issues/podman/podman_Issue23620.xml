  <TITLE>Change quadlet-generator to ignore missing `/run/containers/systemd` directory</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Feature request description As I'm working with Quadlets, I've been seeing this &quot;lstat error&quot;: [root ~]# /usr/libexec/podman/quadlet -dryrun quadlet-generator[18301]: Error occurred resolving path &quot;/run/containers/systemd&quot;: lstat /run/containers/systemd: no such file or directory quadlet-generator[18301]: No files parsed from [/run/containers/systemd /etc/containers/systemd /usr/share/containers/systemd] This leads me to questions like &quot;well, why doesn't it exist?&quot; and &quot;who is responsible for creating it?&quot; Being a busy guy, I've just been silencing it with a quick `mkdir` which of course only works until a reboot and `/run` gets reset. [root ~]# mkdir /run/containers/systemd ### Suggest potential solution I just took a minute to look into it further and it appears to me that the directory missing is not really an *error* condition, and based on #23363 I'm guessing that the user is responsible for creating it if they want it to be used. If these both are true statements, can quadlet-generator be changed to silently ignore when this particular directory is missing? Or log it as a &quot;notice&quot;? ### Have you considered any alternatives? I can use `mkdir` when I'm testing manually but the error will still show up in the boot log. ### Additional context I suspect to a lot of people &quot;error&quot; means &quot;something is broken, you may want to fix it&quot; so ultimately I'm looking for the proper fix</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>quadlet: do not log ENOENT errors There is no point in logging them, the directories not existing is fine and expected and logging these by default when useing -dryrun just causes confusion. Fixes #23620 Signed-off-by: Paul Holzinger &lt;pholzing@redhat.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
