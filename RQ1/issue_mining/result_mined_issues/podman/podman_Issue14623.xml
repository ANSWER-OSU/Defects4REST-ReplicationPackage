  <TITLE>Cirrus: rootless remote system test: &quot;I see everything thrice!&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The `sys remote fedora-36 rootless host` task is running three times: ![sys-sys-sys](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/265639/174135153-c0aa12d5-f92c-4f48-9a97-a91d7a58feaa.png) I suspect this has something to do with `matrix` or something like that. I can probably look into it next week, but I bet it's something very easy for @cevich to find and fix, and maybe it'll magically be solved by next week :)</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>CI: Eliminate triply-redundant rootless-remote jobs We somehow ended up running 'sys remote fedora-36 rootless host' three times in each CI run. Flatten that task, by removing a slight difference in the matrix field. Fixes: #14623 Signed-off-by: Ed Santiago &lt;santiago@redhat.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
