  <TITLE>CI: Reevaluate use of Ubuntu</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>There's a whole swath of tests being skipped on Ubuntu: * Five because of #15025 * One because &quot;BFQ scheduler not supported&quot; * Sixteen because Ubuntu doesn't seem to have SELinux * Four because &quot;checkpointing broken in Ubuntu 2004, 2104, 2110, 2204, ...&quot; AIUI the point of using Ubuntu in CI is testing runc + cgroups v1. The point of testing runc + cgroups v1 is because that's what RHEL8 has, and not that many of us enjoy the panic-scrambles when RHEL8 gating tests fail because we haven't actually been testing very much. This is a place for us to discuss how to improve our coverage.</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>system tests: fix broken runc test Followup to #14613, which was never actually tested until this week in RHEL8 gating tests (see issue #15337). * add missing backslash in '|' expression * allow extra text after error (e.g., &quot;invalid argument&quot;) No way to test this until it makes its way into RHEL8, so, fingers crossed.
