  <TITLE>`healthcheck run` may log error when timer already exists</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We've seen the below error in the system tests while working on https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/15687: &gt; [+1061s] # #| &gt; 'time=&quot;2022-09-08T05:39:35-05:00&quot; level=error msg=&quot;Failed to start transient timer unit: Unit c26ee584b585cd1078cc26692d3f905006b65bda1ec1fc6e2fb19c5218a1d595.timer already exists.\n&quot;' For now, the error will be lowered to debug level but we need to investigate the source of the issue.</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>health checks: restart timers Restart the health-check timers instead of starting them. This will surpress annoying errors stating that an already running timer cannot be started anymore. Also make sure that the transient units/timers are stopped and removed when stopping a container.
