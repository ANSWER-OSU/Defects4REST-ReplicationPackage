  <TITLE>`quay.io/containers/podman-remote-artifacts` requires authorization</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue Description According to [contrib/podmanremoteimage/README.md](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/5311233f86eb40005c0ebe7e13d1f5c0576211c5/contrib/podmanremoteimage/README.md), there are images available at [`quay.io/containers/podman-remote-artifacts`](https://quay.io/containers/podman-remote-artifacts) that contain the static `podman-remote` binaries. However, these images are not publicly accessible (anymore?). Running one of the commands provided in the README fails with an authorization error: ```bash $ podman cp $(podman create --name remote-temp quay.io/containers/podman-remote-artifacts:latest):/podman-remote-static-linux_amd64 . &amp;&amp; podman rm remote-temp Trying to pull quay.io/containers/podman-remote-artifacts:latest...

      <MESSAGE>Remove disused Containerfile and docs Fixes: #21574 The documentation for this image references a quay repository that doesn't exist. It doesn't appear any of these files have been touched since late 2022. Instead of updating the docs, let's just remove the source. It's trivial to recreate if anybody actually needs it for something. Users needing to access remote podman can simply use the `podman` binary present in existing images `quay.io/containers/podman`, `quay.io/podman/stable`, etc. Signed-off-by: Chris Evich &lt;cevich@redhat.com&gt;</MESSAGE>
