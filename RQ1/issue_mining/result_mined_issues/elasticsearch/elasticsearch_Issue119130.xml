  <TITLE>Re-enable tests for config file protections with entitlements</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Elasticsearch has custom Security Manager permissions for protecting some config files. These config file protections need to be implemented in entitlements. Until then, some tests explicitly checking these protections will fail when entitlements are enabled (and security manager is disabled). This issue is a placeholder to re-enable these tests once config file entitlements exist.</DESCRIPTION>
