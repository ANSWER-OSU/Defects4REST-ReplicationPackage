    <MESSAGE>[ML] Refactor SSE Parsing (#125959) ServerSentEvent is now a record with `event` and `data`, rather than it being a record for value with a separate `ServerSentEventField`. - `value` was renamed to `data` - `hasValue` was renamed to `hasData` - Parsing was refactored to read more like its spec: writing to a buffer and flushing when we reach a blank newline - We now support multiline data payloads</MESSAGE>

      <MESSAGE>[Entitlements] Fix PolicyUtils and PolicyUtilsTests on Windows (#126185) This PR fixes 2 issues discovered around PolicyUtils (and PolicyUtilsTests) when running CI on Windows: - in tests, absolute paths like always are different, this fix updates the tests to account for the difference. - on Windows, Files.move was failing because we were parsing the Entitlement policy but not closing the stream in a timely manner. This causes plugin installation (and related CI tests) to fail 70% of the time. Fixed by closing the stream properly Fixes #126176</MESSAGE>
