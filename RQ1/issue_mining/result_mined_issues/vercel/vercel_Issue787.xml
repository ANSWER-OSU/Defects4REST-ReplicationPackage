    <COMMIT>
      <MESSAGE>Remove Microsoft Azure deployment section from README.md (#1138) Apparently azure deployment was listed in the docs before it was actually supported by now-cli. I just went through and become confused by the same error message and found the issue: https://github.com/zeit/now-cli/issues/787 It seems it's easy to remove this section and add it back later when the feature is added</MESSAGE>
