  <TITLE>show the entire directory</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I'm testing the example of **serverless-ssr-reddit** of now-examples but when I try to access http://localhost:300/ i receive the following &lt;img width=&quot;289&quot; alt=&quot;56072796-57a22b00-5d60-11e9-8f74-9873fd7469ba&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16585386/56074034-4b729980-5d71-11e9-96aa-3d21fe9f2546.png&quot;&gt; but when I deploy the project with ▲Now it shows me the entire directory &lt;img width=&quot;1280&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2019-04-12 at 22 10 10&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16585386/56074042-7fe65580-5d71-11e9-9d6c-d11ba6356224.png&quot;&gt; It would be a good idea to have this in `now dev` ❤️</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>[now dev] Render directory listing for Now v2 projects Before directory listings only worked for &quot;all static&quot; deployments since `now dev` would shell out to `serve-handler` to do the rendering. Now the directory listing rendering logic is moved into `now dev` which allows projects with Lambdas to also serve the directory listing (previously they would just 404). This removes the special-casing of &quot;all static&quot; deployments so that there's only one code path. Fixes #2161. Fixes #2417.</MESSAGE>
