      <MESSAGE>Add `publish.sh` script for CircleCI (#228) * Add `publish.sh` script for CircleCI Centralize the publishing logic for CircleCI to use. There was a bug in the previous &quot;Potentially publish stable release&quot; branch, such that it would be executed for non-tagged commits. The new publish script checks if there are indeed any tags for the commit, and bails if there are none. As an additional bonus, there's now only one publish step in the CircleCI config, because the publish script determines stable vs. canary based on the tag name. * Remove `echo`</MESSAGE>
