  <TITLE>Command options not visible in cmder</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>_From @darahak on August 27, 2017 21:32_ I use Cmder on Windows and when I use `--help` for any command, I cannot see the options unless I highlight them. Some descriptions are also hard to read because of the low contrast between their background and font color. I'm not sure if the problem is about Now or Cmder. Screenshots below. &lt;details&gt; &lt;summary&gt;Current display&lt;/summary&gt; ![now-default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11488612/29754059-58208276-8b7e-11e7-9070-cc9f4c88cba5.png) &lt;/details&gt; &lt;details&gt; &lt;summary&gt;Highlighting hidden text&lt;/summary&gt; ![now-hl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11488612/29754078-884b445e-8b7e-11e7-9334-12f0d528f69f.png) &lt;/details&gt; _Copied from original issue: zeit/now#60_</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>[now-static-build] Use `yarn` when invoking `now-dev` script (#747) `yarn` used to be used, but was switched over to `npm` in #636. The problem with `npm` is that when the `ignoreScripts` config option is enabled in the user's `.npmrc` file, then `npm run …` does not get invoked. This makes sense for `npm i`, but doesn't really make sense if you're explicitly _trying_ to run a package script via `npm run`, and in fact breaks `now dev`. `yarn` has a similar option to ignore scripts, however it has the more understandable behavior that when you do `yarn run` then the script is actually run. There isn't a concern about if the user does not have `yarn` installed since `now dev` bundles its own copy of yarn and uses that version.</MESSAGE>
