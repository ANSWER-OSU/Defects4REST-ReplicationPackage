  <TITLE>Tunnel an alias to your local dev machine</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hey there! I've been working on a GitHub integration and kept feeling as though I wanted a faster iteration cycle between making changes on my dev box and testing those changes via GitHub. To combat that, I put together [`tunnel.now`](https://github.com/divmain/tunnel.now). It functions similarly to [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), except that its a Node process deployed to the `now` cloud. That means I can alias my GitHub webhook endpoint to this instance, and tunnel all incoming connections to my local machine. It occurred to me, however, that this doesn't need to live as a separate project, and might find utility if integrated into the `now` cli itself. However, I wanted to reach out and gauge interest before submitting a PR. Let me know! Dale</DESCRIPTION>
