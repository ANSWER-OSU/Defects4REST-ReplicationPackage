  <TITLE>ENOENT: no such file or directory</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>So, I'm going to leave this here for now: https://zeit.co/spences10/tweet-bot-playground/rqbujyiyqk/source?f=index.js Some screenshots too fore when I destroy that instance, but first an explanation, I guess. Trying to store a temp file [~150kb] in the `tmp` folder, I get `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '../tmp/nasa.jpg'` I was getting permission errors before but that was when I was trying to create the file in `src` after reading some similar issues I realise that it should be in the `tmp` folder, so here the structure: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/234708/26035143/6ef60a32-38bf-11e7-9c22-e4512faf23d7.png) And here is where the relative file path is being fed in: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/234708/26035174/e5eac20e-38bf-11e7-9ad3-73cf6fc697e4.png) I'm a bit confused as to why if cant be found, anyone have any feedback? Thanks.</DESCRIPTION>
