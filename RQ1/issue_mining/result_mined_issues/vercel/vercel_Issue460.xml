  <TITLE>Feature Request: Addons from CLI</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I would like the ability to be able to setup external services like Redis or MongoDB from either the command line or a simple web interface like Heroku does. https://elements.heroku.com/addons Not only would this make things much easier for developers, but it would bring in extra revenue to your company through vendor commissions.</DESCRIPTION>
