  <TITLE>How can I write files to the local storage?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>My app downloads an image to local storage, then uploads it elsewhere. When i try to download to `./`, I get `permission denied` When I try to download to `./tmp`, the subsequent `read` operation (for the upload) fails. I see a few issues in this repo w/ similar problems, but they're all dealing w/ `next.js`, which I'm not using. Is writing to local storage possible?</DESCRIPTION>
