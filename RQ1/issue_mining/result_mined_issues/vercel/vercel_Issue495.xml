  <TITLE>Feature Request: Selectable UI Elements</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I know this is a broad request. Great if for some tasks we could start to see some built in ui selectors, i.e. lists or options via a lib like inquirer: https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>[now-go] Ignore folders in `analyze.go` (#503)(#504) (#506) * [now-go] Ignore folders in `analyze.go` (#503)(#504) This commit adds some changes to the way the AST for the source is built. The `analyze.go` program now ignores every `vendor`, `.git` and `testdata` folder. This improves performance, since `vendor` and `.git` are usually large folders (#504). By ignoring `testdata`, we mimick the behaviour of `go build` and avoid failing the parsing because of invalid Go code inside of `testdata` (#503) * [now-go] Don't ignore `.git` in analyze (#506) If the user wants to ignore `.git`, he should put it into `.nowignore`</MESSAGE>
