Am I missing a config step or is something broken?</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>[now-build-utils] Add `FsFileRef.fromFsPath()` helper function (#217) * [now-build-utils] Add `FsFileRef.fromFile()` helper function This helper function is very similar to the raw `FsFileRef` constructor, however it stats the file to retrieve the proper `mode`, so that settings like executable bits are not lost. * Rename to `FileFsRef.fromFsPath()`</MESSAGE>

      <MESSAGE>[now-go] Refactor to be platform-aware for `now dev` (#216) * [now-go] Refactor to be platform-aware for `now dev` This is mostly to have `now dev` work, but also just a general cleanup of the builder codebase. Previously, the `get-exported-function-name` Go binary was being compiled at publish-time for &quot;linux x64&quot; architecture, since that is what AWS Lambda expects. In order for `@now/go` to work on MacOS (or any other platform not compatible with &quot;linux x64&quot;) the helper program must be compiled by the actual host machine, so that it builds a MacOS binary for example. So building `get-exported-function-name` has been moved from the &quot;publish&quot; step to the &quot;postinstall&quot; step. Similarly, the `go` binary itself used to be downloaded explicitly by the `build()` function during build-time. This step has been moved to the &quot;postinstall&quot; script as well, so that said binary may be compiled. This also makes sense because the `@now/go` builder will be downloaded by `now dev` once, so this way the `go` binary only needs to be downloaded once as well, rather than once per build. Any assumptions about `GOOS` and `GOARCH` have also been removed. * Don't lint the `go` tarball directory * Use GitHub URL for the go bridge * Tweak comments * Use `glob()` instead of `FileFsRef` `FileFsRef` appears to lose executable permissions on the file, whereas `glob()` works as expected.</MESSAGE>
