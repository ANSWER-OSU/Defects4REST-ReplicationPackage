  <TITLE>Memory management in case of sleep</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>How does Now handle a node app's memory when it is set to sleep? Will the app completely relaunch or will it continue where it left off in terms of what is still stored in memory? Can I write files to disk and if so, will they survive if the app is put to sleep or should I assume that the app always runs for the first time? TLDR; can I store something and rely on that it is there in case of a shutdown?</DESCRIPTION>
