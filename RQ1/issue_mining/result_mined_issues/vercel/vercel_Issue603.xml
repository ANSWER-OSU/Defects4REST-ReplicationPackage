  <TITLE>now.json configuration file not being honored</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>According to the [configuration](https://zeit.co/docs/features/configuration#`type`-(string)) page, if I add a `now.json` file with the contents: ```json { &quot;files&quot;: [ &quot;dist&quot; ], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;docker&quot; } ``` and I have both a `package.json` and `Dockerfile`, when i execute `$ now`, it should not ask me which type i'd like to deploy and it should upload the `dist` folder even though `dist` is in my `.gitignore` file. My `now.json` file doesn't seem to be honored as I'm getting asked which type of deployment I want: ```sh $ now &gt; Deploying ~/Sites/mysite under myusername &gt; Two manifests found. Press [n] to deploy or re-run with --flag &gt; [1] package.json --npm &gt; [2] Dockerfile --docker &gt; Aborted ``` and i'm also getting an error that my `dist` folder doesn't exist (which this issue is resolved if i remove `/dist` from my `.gitignore` file): ```sh $ now --docker ... Step 2 : COPY dist /usr/share/nginx/html &gt; lstat dist: no such file or directory ```</DESCRIPTION>
