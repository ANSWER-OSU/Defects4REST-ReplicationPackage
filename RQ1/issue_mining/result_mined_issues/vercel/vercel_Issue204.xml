  <TITLE>Document all the now package.json config options</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Currently I can't find the various now `package.json` config options documented anywhere. The only way I discovered that `now.alias` existed was by accidently seeing it while browsing the source code trying to fix an unrelated bug. Also the `--config` option isn't documented anywhere, I'm guessing it can contain the same options as the ones in the `package.json`?</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>[now-bash] Use `mktemp` dry run syntax that is compatible with BSD (#204) For `now dev` running on a MacOS machine, some of our builders will need to be adjusted to be &quot;platform-aware&quot;. In this case, `mktemp` is provided by BSD instead of GNU, which doesn't support the long form `--dry-run` flag, however both support the `-u` flag which does the same thing.</MESSAGE>
