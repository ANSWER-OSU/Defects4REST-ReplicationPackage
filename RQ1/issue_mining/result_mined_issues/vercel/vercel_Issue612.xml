  <TITLE>Bug: Unable to deploy static apps</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I think you have a bug with static deployments and instance count. I am unable to deploy any static apps when my instance limit is hit, even though static deployments do not count towards instances. Error message: `Error! Too many active deployment instances` Steps: 1. Use all account instances with dynamic apps 2. Deploy a static app ![screen shot 2017-06-01 at 12 58 56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5610087/26678851/6f7d47d6-46ca-11e7-90b7-fa83c966e371.png) `a`, `b` and `c` are dynamic apps `static` and `static2` are static apps</DESCRIPTION>
