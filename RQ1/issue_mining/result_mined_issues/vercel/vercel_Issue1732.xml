  <TITLE>Broken deployment-error link</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Just received an unspecified error message after my files where uploaded: ``` ... &gt; Error! Your deployment failed. Please retry later. More: https://err.sh/now-cli/deployment-error ``` The link [https://err.sh/now-cli/deployment-error](https://err.sh/now-cli/deployment-error) redirects to [https://github.com/zeit/now-cli/blob/master/errors/deployment-error.md](https://github.com/zeit/now-cli/blob/master/errors/deployment-error.md) which does not exist. Would suggest to either fix the redirect or create the doc file in case it is missing. Using now-cli v2.</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>[cli] Add in a message for `deployment-error-message` We have a link to an error page here: https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/src/commands/deploy/latest.js#L67, however that page is currently a 404. Fixes https://github.com/vercel/vercel/issues/1732. This is an attempt to explain the error a bit more. Because there are many possible causes of a deployment error, this mostly focuses on explaining how to get to the logs.</MESSAGE>
