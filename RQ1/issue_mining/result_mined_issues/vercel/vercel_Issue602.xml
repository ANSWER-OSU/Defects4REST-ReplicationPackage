  <TITLE>Yarn global downloads now every time</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5027156/26564108/fbc22f08-44dc-11e7-9cd8-85da1312f92f.png) Whenever i install something globally, `now` seems to download itself again? and build? output when done ``` ❯ yarn global add fkill-cli yarn global v0.24.6 warning No license field [1/4] Resolving packages... [2/4] Fetching packages... [3/4] Linking dependencies... [4/4] Building fresh packages... [1/1] ⠂ now: &gt; For the sources, check out: https://github.com/zeit/now-cli success Installed &quot;fkill-cli@3.6.0&quot; with binaries: - fkill warning No license field ✨ Done in 34.88s. ``` I guess it's because the ` Building fresh packages` step, but I think this should be fixed, since it makes global install a lot slower</DESCRIPTION>
