  <TITLE>Feedback on v1 release of now.json @beta</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>_From @babakness on August 3, 2017 23:16_ Feature request: Being able to launch a service into a VPC so that it can access services (like a database) would be awesome. Perhaps there could be a key for &quot;vpc&quot; in now.json accompanied by the matching function. I have noted that there &quot;regions&quot; key which is an array. If launch simultaneously to multiple region, I suppose the idea here is to load balance between them? Perhaps, then, vpc is an object which provides a region-to-vpc map. In which case it seems that the &quot;regions&quot; option could be unnecessary since the regions are the VPC keys. ``` &quot;regions&quot;: { &quot;us-west-1&quot;: '192.168.0.0/16, &quot;us-west-2&quot;: '192.168.0.0/16 } ``` implies values for &quot;regions&quot; of &quot;us-west-1&quot; and &quot;us-west-2&quot; _Copied from original issue: zeit/now#42_</DESCRIPTION>
