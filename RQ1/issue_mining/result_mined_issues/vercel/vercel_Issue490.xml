  <TITLE>Feature Request: Old Deployments Pruning</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>There is a lot of 'pruning' that one has to do for past deployments. I'm not sure if its just because of being in testing mode, but there is a lot of deleting going on and I've deleted instances unintentionally. I don't know what the answer is, but finding ways to manage this a better would be helpful, particularly for dev envs.</DESCRIPTION>
