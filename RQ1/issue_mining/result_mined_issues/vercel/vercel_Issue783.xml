  <TITLE>Add caching logic similar to now-cli's</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>_From @matheuss on July 21, 2017 3:50_ In the current `now-cli` we have a logic to store the user details (username, email etc) with a TTL of 8h. I didn't copy it over when copying the login/deployment code over because I want to improve it. I'd want `~/.now/cache.json`, that'd be used specifically to store stuff like that. Specially because username, for example, is not a configuration option – it depends on the API token. @rauchg @nkzawa `~/.now/cache.json` sounds great? Also cc @leo, since we would share such file with Now Desktop Assigning myself since I'd like to implement it and I implemented the current logic on `now-cli`, so it'll be trivial to do it here. _Copied from original issue: zeit/now#37_</DESCRIPTION>
