  <TITLE>deploy after sign up if command was `now [deploy]`</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>This supports a single command sign up and deployment flow, so projects like [frontarm/navi](https://github.com/frontarm/navi/blob/9a87bcdcbfc0f37a24d9488616dff65407606370/examples/blog-typescript/package.json) can use `now` as their deployment script and it works in one command, even if the user doesn't yet have an account. Currently if you issue `now` as a new user you get the sign up flow but need to run `now` a second time for it to actually do the deploy.</DESCRIPTION>
