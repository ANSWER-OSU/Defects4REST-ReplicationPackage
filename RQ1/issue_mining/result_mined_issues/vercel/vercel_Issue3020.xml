  <TITLE>Render prompt when deploying home directory</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Currently, if you're deploying your home directory accidentally, we're not telling you: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6170607/64913581-e9182d80-d742-11e9-8121-f1813aa41756.png) In the case of my machine, I got an error because it wasn't able to read my `Cookies` directory. In other cases, however, you wouldn't get this error (for example when setting up a refresh non-GUI Ubuntu VM). To make it more clear that you might accidentally be deploying your entire home dir, we want to render this prompt: &gt; You are deploying your home directory. Do you want to continue?</DESCRIPTION>
