  <TITLE>Remove old deployments for app that are not aliased</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I'm using `now` to deploy my blog, and trying to make deployment seamless by automatically removing old deployments that are not aliased (the non-production ones). I make sure to name all my deployments under the same app name, so they all show up when I type `now ls domain.com` However, if I redeploy, I get a list of all former deployments and have to manually delete them. For the time being I wrote this deploy script. Is there any easier way than this? A `now rm --not-aliased my-app` would be amazing to have. ``` echo &quot;Deploying $DOMAIN...&quot; now --static ./public --token=$TOKEN -n $DOMAIN -a $DOMAIN ALIAS=&quot;$(now alias list|grep &quot;$DOMAIN&quot;|awk '/now\.sh/ { print $2}')&quot; echo &quot;Currently aliased to $ALIAS, removing all others for $DOMAIN...&quot; now ls $DOMAIN | grep -v &quot;$ALIAS&quot; | awk '/.*([A-Za-z0-9]{24}).*/ { print $1; }' | xargs -I{} now -y rm {} ``` I would be happy to make a PR for now-cli if this is a wanted feature. There is definitely a more elegant way to do this from within the app's code.</DESCRIPTION>
