  <TITLE>How to debug deployment?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I'm deploying an application with Docker. I've had a couple successful deploys, but now all of the sudden, I'm getting a cryptic &quot;502: An error occured with your deployment.&quot; error. Is there anyway to debug this? I'm not sure what's causing this error, but the docker container works perfectly fine on my local machine. I'm relatively new to `now` and I've been burning through my 20 deploys very quickly with these failures. Any help would be much appreciated.</DESCRIPTION>
