  <TITLE>Fix quickstart</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Reviewing the overall product docs, I think there needs to be a certain continuation to the individual product docs from the global docs. For example, after going through the Confluent quick start [http://y2zjnzc0owi5nmy2m2jkmzfjm2m0mmi1yzq3mwjmnzu2ode0.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/docs/quickstart.html] that assumes you've started the service, I expect to just see the steps to try out some features/APIs. Specifically, let's separate the installation from the quick start. The quick start should only go through the APIs and not starting the service. The installation section should have the package install and service start including starting the dependent services.</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Clean up the quickstart. Post-installation instructions for running services into the installation section so the quickstart focuses on how to use the service. Flesh out the quickstart by adding consumer and Avro examples. Fixes #34.</MESSAGE>
