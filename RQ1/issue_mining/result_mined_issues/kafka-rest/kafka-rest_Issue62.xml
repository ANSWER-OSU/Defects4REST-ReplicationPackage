  <TITLE>Reduce time required to run tests</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The tests take a long time to run. Some of this overhead is unavoidable with the integration tests. However, there's probably some low-hanging fruit in ClusterTestHarness that might make a big difference: - Default number of brokers is 3. This is probably overkill for almost every test. - Might be able to pull up/tear down brokers in parallel, although it would be worth checking how long they take to start up/tear down before trying to make the parallel version work. - Schema registry only needs to be started if we're going to use Avro. Only a couple of the tests need Avro support.</DESCRIPTION>
