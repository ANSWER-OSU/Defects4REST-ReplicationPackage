  <TITLE>Add support for compression, other global producer configs</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Settings like compression can probably be configured globally just by exposing the producer config option as one of the REST proxy's config options and passing it along to both the binary and avro producers. The implementation should be trivial; the primary question is how we want to expose these options, e.g. by prefixing all the producer options with &quot;producer.&quot; and forwarding everything, by allowing options to pass-through if they aren't processed by the KafkaRestConfig, or maybe some other approach.</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Add support for producer and consumer configuration overrides. Pass configuration options provided to the KafkaRestConfig along to producer and consumer instances. This allows the operator of the proxy to provide overrides for the default configs. This is critical for some site-wide config options like compression that should not be specified per-request. This approach has the drawback that switching producer/consumer implementations potentially causes breakage since config options may change. This is particularly a potential issue when we upgrade from the old consumer to the new consumer in the near future. This may cause some additional complexity for deployment, but since extra config options shouldn't cause a problem, there should be a safe upgrade path where both sets of options are provided. This also doesn't yet expose the full set of options to user requests, so it's less of a commitment in that it affects operators of the proxy, but not users of the API. Fixes #51.</MESSAGE>
