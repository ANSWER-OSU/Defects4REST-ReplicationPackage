  <TITLE>can't start the project</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I'm unable to run the project, as its apparently using a non-published version of spring-boot-starter-parent ? It would be great to have some tags in the project, so I could use a stable version. ``` Downloading: https://repo.spring.io/snapshot/org/springframework/session/spring-session-bom/Apple-SR1/spring-session-bom-Apple-SR1.pom Downloading: https://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/session/spring-session-bom/Apple-SR1/spring-session-bom-Apple-SR1.pom Downloaded: https://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/session/spring-session-bom/Apple-SR1/spring-session-bom-Apple-SR1.pom (3 KB at 7.5 KB/sec) [ERROR] [ERROR] Some problems were encountered while processing the POMs: [ERROR] 'dependencies.dependency.version' for org.webjars:webjars-locator:jar is missing. @ line 85, column 17 @ [ERROR] The build could not read 1 project -&gt; [Help 1] [ERROR] [ERROR] The project org.springframework.samples:spring-petclinic:2.0.0 (/Users/domdorn/gfm/spring-petclinic/pom.xml) has 1 error [ERROR] 'dependencies.dependency.version' for org.webjars:webjars-locator:jar is missing. @ line 85, column 17 [ERROR] [ERROR] To see the full stack trace of the errors, re-run Maven with the -e switch.
