  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;i&gt;Imported from JIRA &lt;a href=&quot;https://jira.lyrasis.org/browse/DS-102&quot;&gt;[DS-102]&lt;/a&gt; created by bollini&lt;/i&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is possible to complete a submission without any files also if the skip upload functionality is disabled. This is true with both JSPUI and XMLUI&lt;br/&gt; For reproduce this you need to go through a submission with multi-file option checked. &lt;br/&gt; First upload a file and go to the verify step, now using the progress bar go back to the upload step.&lt;br/&gt; Remove the uploaded file and use the progress bar to go at the verify step or next. Now you are able to complete the submission without files.&lt;/p&gt;</DESCRIPTION>
