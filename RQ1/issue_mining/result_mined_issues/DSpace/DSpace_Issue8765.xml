  <TITLE>Reset Password does not work from the Admin Panel when Captcha verification enabled</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** When I am logged in as admin and try to reset a password for another eperson, it will throw an error: Error when trying to reset password An error occured when attempting to reset the password for the account associated with the following email address: 213523@ids.upchiapas.edu.mx. The same behavior encountered also in the DSpace 7.5 DEMO website. **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. MUST have [Google Recaptcha](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC7x/CAPTCHA+Verification) enabled to reproduce this bug. 2. Log in as Admin 3. Go to Access Control -&gt; People -&gt; Edit a Person -&gt; Reset Password Related: The Bug was first described in #https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues/8670 However, the angular fix (#2107) did not resolve the problem. In the Network Tab, I see how the request is sent properly (with the correct parameter =forgot), but the Backend responds with 403 Forbidden. Maybe is something in the backend that should be changed as well?</DESCRIPTION>
