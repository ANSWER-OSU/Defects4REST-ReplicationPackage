  <TITLE>Migrate from deprecated &quot;openjdk&quot; Docker image</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>DSpace currently uses the [`openjdk`](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/) Docker image, which is now officially deprecated: &gt; This image is officially deprecated and all users are recommended to find and use suitable replacements ASAP. Some examples of other Official Image alternatives (listed in alphabetical order with no intentional or implied preference): &gt; &gt; * [amazoncorretto](https://hub.docker.com/_/amazoncorretto) &gt; * [eclipse-temurin](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin) &gt; * [ibm-semeru-runtimes](https://hub.docker.com/_/ibm-semeru-runtimes) &gt; * [ibmjava](https://hub.docker.com/_/ibmjava) &gt; * [sapmachine](https://hub.docker.com/_/sapmachine) While I don't know which image would be the most appropriate choice to migrate to for the whole community, it's clear that a different image needs to be used.</DESCRIPTION>
