  <TITLE>Menu toggle from right to left</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Would like to request a feature where it's possible to toggle the side menu where the search bar is from the right side to the left. This is in regards to users making that change on their own browser or account. I've attached a screenshot so hopefully help explain what menu I mean. The one where it has the search bar, and Browse, My Account, Discover, etc. ![Dspace menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2236722/127877291-acfa5327-0272-4cdb-bdfe-9b2cc6c6cc88.png)</DESCRIPTION>
