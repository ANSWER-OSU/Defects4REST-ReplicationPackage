  <TITLE>Hibernate warns of &quot;legacy cache name&quot;s</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** It seems that Hibernate has changed the names of two caches that it looks for by default. Warnings are logged, suggesting that we rename our caches. We should keep up with these changes. **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Start a DSpace webapp. 2. Look in log/dspace.log for HHH90001007 warnings. **Expected behavior** No HHH90001007 warnings.</DESCRIPTION>
