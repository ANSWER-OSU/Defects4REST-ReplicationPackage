  <TITLE>[DS-70] Browse Re-Retrieves Items Unnecessarily? - ID: 2031535</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;i&gt;Imported from JIRA &lt;a href=&quot;https://jira.lyrasis.org/browse/DS-70&quot;&gt;[DS-70]&lt;/a&gt; created by kipkorir2008&lt;/i&gt; &lt;p&gt;It appears the BrowseInfo.getBrowseItemResults( Context ) re-retrieves all&lt;br/&gt; of the Items the browse retrieved previously.&lt;br/&gt; BrowseInfo.getBrowseItemResults(), however, does not. The attached patch&lt;br/&gt; simply wires them both to behave the same, and not retrieve Items twice&lt;br/&gt; unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has been pointed out that it is feasible that there may be some&lt;br/&gt; situations in which the BrowseInfo is kept in memory for long enough that&lt;br/&gt; re-creating this cache is desirable. Perhaps if this is the case, some form&lt;br/&gt; of aging would be a desirable addition (e.g. if the cached data is more&lt;br/&gt; than 1 minute old, re-retrieve all of the Items).&lt;/p&gt;</DESCRIPTION>
