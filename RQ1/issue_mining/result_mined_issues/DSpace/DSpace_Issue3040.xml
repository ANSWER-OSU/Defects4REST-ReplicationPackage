  <TITLE>process scheduler does not keep track of special groups</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** Whenever a process is scheduled, information about user scheduling it is tracked. But we don't keep track of special groups, if any, active for the user at the moment of scheduling. In such cases, if scheduled process requires permission(s) related to a special group, it might fail. To provide a scenario if an user is granted as administrator by shibboleth, but he / she isn't administrator according to dspace systems, and with administrator grant can schedule a process, when the process is triggered and permissions are re-checked we do not have evidence of previous administrator grant.</DESCRIPTION>
