  <TITLE>Request a Copy's &quot;helpdesk&quot; strategy requires authentication to respond</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** Discovered while testing #8319 In DSpace 6, selecting the &quot;helpdesk&quot; strategy for Request a Copy allowed anyone receiving the helpdesk email to respond to the request _without authenticating into DSpace._ This is currently not possible in DSpace 7. **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Activate request a copy with Helpdesk Strategy: https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC7x/Request+a+Copy#RequestaCopy-(Optional)RequestingacopywithHelpDeskworkflow 2. As anonymous user, look at an embargoed item, click on the file to display the request a copy form. 3. Complete and send the request a copy form 4. As helpdesk staff, look at the email inbox 5. Open the Request a copy email and click on the link to respond to it. 6. **You are now required to login to DSpace** in order to respond. Previously this was available anonymously. 7. After logging in, you can approve or decline the request. **Expected behavior** You should be able to approve or deny the request without authenticating. The link sent to the helpdesk staff includes a unique token which is all that is necessary to respond to the request. **Related work** Related to #8319 and originally reported in #8304</DESCRIPTION>
