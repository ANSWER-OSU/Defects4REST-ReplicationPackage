  <TITLE>OpenAIRE v4 default crosswalk: Revised mapping for Accepted and Issued dates</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>## Context The particular piece of code that needs revision is https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/main/dspace/config/crosswalks/oai/metadataFormats/oai_openaire.xsl#L740-L754 What basically happens there is dc.date.issued and dc.date.accepted are taken as input, and are being exposed as BOTH &quot;Accepted&quot; and &quot;Issued&quot;. As described here in the [OpenAIRE guidelines](https://openaire-guidelines-for-literature-repository-managers.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/field_embargoenddate.html), &quot;Accepted&quot; should very specifically be used for the start of an embargo. ## Proposal Only dc.date.issued should be considered as the input for the crosswalk to both Issued and Accepted. The rationale is that embargo start dates generally start counting as of date of publication, and dc.date.issued is the commonly used field for keeping the data of publication. The current crosswalk is ok if only dc.date.issued is filled out, because in that case it doesn't matter anyway that dc.date.accepted is also included in the crosswalk. But as soon as you have items where either ONLY dc.date.accepted has a value (and it's NOT the publication date!) or dc.date.issued and dc.date.accepted are both filled out, the crosswalk produces conflicting and incorrect results. ## To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Create an item that has both dc.date.issued and dc.date.accepted filled out 2. Run oai import so that the metadata show up in the OpenAIRE OAI endpoint. ## Expected behavior dc.date.issued should be exposed as &quot;Accepted&quot; and &quot;Issued&quot; in the crosswalked record.</DESCRIPTION>
