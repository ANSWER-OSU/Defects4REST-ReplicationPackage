  <TITLE>Warning xsl:stylesheet when doing OAI import -c</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Describe the bug** When performing a `oai import -c` action, an warning is shown. I had the same issue when reviewing this PR: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/2756#issuecomment-852967636 and the same still occurs today with DS 7.5-snapshot with a migrated repository. ``` OAI 2.0 manager action started Clearing index Index cleared Using full import. Full import Warning at xsl:stylesheet on line 14 column 35 Unrecognized version 1.1: treated as 1.0 Total: 984 items Total: 1 items Purging cached OAI responses. OAI 2.0 manager action ended. It took 75 seconds. ``` **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. I just did a `[dspace]/bin/dspace oai import -c` with migrated content. 2. I've also tried docker `docker-compose -f cli.yml run --rm dspace-cli oai import -c` According to https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/2756#issuecomment-852967636 this issue started occurring with this PR. **Expected behavior** No warning shown. **Related work** This issue has been around: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/2756#issuecomment-852967636 https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/2856#issuecomment-933701753</DESCRIPTION>
