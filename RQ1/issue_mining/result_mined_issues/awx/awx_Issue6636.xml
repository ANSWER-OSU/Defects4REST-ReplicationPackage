  <TITLE>Copying WFJTs renders a copy with an empty workflow</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report ##### SUMMARY When attempting to copy a small workflow (with a single approval node), I found that the copied workflow launched and completed without requesting an approval. Further investigation showed that the copied workflow visualizer showed an empty workflow. ##### ENVIRONMENT * AWX version: latest ##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE Both @jakemcdermott and I were able to reproduce this (osx, fedora) 1. Create a new workflow job template. 2. Add one approval node to the workflow. Save it, and launch it. Do not approve the workflow, so it stays in a pending state. 3. Copy the workflow using the copy button in the template list. 4. Attempt to launch the copied workflow. ##### EXPECTED RESULTS The workflow also waits for approval. ##### ACTUAL RESULTS The workflow does not wait for approval. Inspection shows that the workflow is empty.</DESCRIPTION>
