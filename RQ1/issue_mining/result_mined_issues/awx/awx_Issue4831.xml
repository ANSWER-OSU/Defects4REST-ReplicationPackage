  <TITLE>templates change dialog states &quot;Credential&quot; instead of plural</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>the interface should state &quot;Credentials&quot; as it is possible to select a multitude of credentials. Checking for a few types: * Machine -&gt; single selection * Network -&gt; single selection * Vault -&gt; multiple selections As its possible to have at least one of each type (and for Vault even multiple), there is definitely the option to have a multitude of credentials. - My current test setup shows right now 5 items listed in this single box. Thus a plural in the headline is indicated.</DESCRIPTION>
