  <TITLE>Workflow Run On &quot;Change&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We are still evaluating Ansible/AWX and we are noticing some limitations we thought it would be great to have. ##### ISSUE TYPE When setting up Workflow we think Run On Change should be an option. For example, Whenever a change is detected we would want the same Template to run again x number of times until no more change is detected. For example - if a change keeps occurring that means something is wrong with the Env and requires human intervention. Also, it would be great to be able to send an Email whenever there is a change detected. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20629911/72360079-4944bf00-36a4-11ea-85cd-e7a8803149a8.png) Thank you,</DESCRIPTION>
