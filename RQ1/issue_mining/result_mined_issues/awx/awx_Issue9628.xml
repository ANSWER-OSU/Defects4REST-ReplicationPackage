    <MESSAGE>Merge pull request #9208 from mabashian/job-output-search-2 Add support for filtering and pagination on job output SUMMARY link #6612 link #5906 This PR adds the ability to filter job events and also includes logic to handle fetching filtered job events across different pages. Note that the verbosity dropdown included in #5906 is not included in this work. I don't think that's possible without api changes. As part of this work, I converted JobOutput.jsx from a class based component to a functional component. I've tried my best to make sure that all existing functionality has remained the same by comparing the experience of this branch to devel. Like the old UI, the output filter is disabled while the job is running.
