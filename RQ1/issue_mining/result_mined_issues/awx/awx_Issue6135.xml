  <TITLE>Information Request - OS Support</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Information Request ##### SUMMARY I haven't been able to find a definitive answer on this. Since AWX is just the upstream variant of Ansible Tower, I wanted to confirm whether AWX still supports Ubuntu as a distribution choice for deployment, despite Tower no longer supporting it. I ask since CentOS was currently my choice for deploying, but has proven to be exceptionally more of a pain in the ass to get running than when I used Ubuntu for similar things.</DESCRIPTION>
