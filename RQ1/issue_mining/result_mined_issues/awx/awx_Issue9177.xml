We should do that at some point. We use CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX_WHITELIST and mention about it in docs as well here: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/administration/oauth2_token_auth.html#application-using-authorization-code-grant-type</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>Merge pull request #9537 from AlexSCorey/lingUIUpdate Updates Ling UI SUMMARY This PR updates Ling ui. One of the reasons for updating this dependency was that they were deprecating withI18n(). They changed their minds on that so we didn't need to urgently remove all those HOCs. Thus, we can now make that conversion a bit slower a couple of files at a time. One other thing: When we are changing the string based on a count of an item (ie. Cancel Job vs. Cancel Jobs) we should use ling ui's &lt;Plural&gt; component. However, in order to show the update strings passed to that component the developer will have to run npm run extract-strings each time they are changed to render the updated strings properly. More info here.
