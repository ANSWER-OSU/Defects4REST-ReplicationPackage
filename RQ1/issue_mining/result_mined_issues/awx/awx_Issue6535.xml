  <TITLE>Project updates aren't pulling the latest commit</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report ##### SUMMARY When performing a project update on an existing project it's not pulling the latest commit. ##### ENVIRONMENT * AWX version: 10.0.0 * AWX install method: openshift * Ansible version: NA * Operating System: * Web Browser: ##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE Create a new project to point to a Git branch, take note of the revision and the commit in your branch from git. Push a new commit to the branch and take note of the commit and then perform a project update in AWX. You'll see the revision in AWX doesn't reflect the latest commit in the branch. This happens with all variants of SCM Update options (clean/delete/update rev) If you create a new project with a different name only then does it pull the latest commit. ##### EXPECTED RESULTS AWX updates the project to the latest commit ##### ACTUAL RESULTS AWX doesn't update the project to the latest commit. It's stuck with the commit from the first time the project is setup. ##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</DESCRIPTION>
