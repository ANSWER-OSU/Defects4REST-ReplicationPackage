    <MESSAGE>Merge pull request #9613 from mabashian/8921-node-cred-password Prevent users from selecting credentials that prompt for passwords on workflow nodes and schedules SUMMARY link #8921 If a user selects a job template with default credentials that prompt for passwords (but does not prompt for credentials) then the user should not be allowed to create the node and a different JT must be selected: If a user selects a credential that prompts for passwords when creating/editing a workflow node or schedule then we show this error: If a user removes a credential that exists in the default collection of credentials on the JT then it must be replaced. This is the error we show: If a user attempts to create a schedule for a job template with default credentials that prompt (but does not prompt for credentials) then the API responds with this error: I believe this UX is consistent with the old UI but I am double checking that now.
