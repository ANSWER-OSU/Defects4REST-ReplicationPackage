  <TITLE>Clicking &quot;Back&quot; after Schedule deletion causes page reload error</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report ##### SUMMARY Immediately after deleting one or more schedules from the schedules tab of a job template, clicking the back button results in a reload error where the page will not load, but stays blank and displays a spinning circIe indefinitely. Clicking refresh doesn't work. Only clicking one of the links in the app, in order to navigate elsewhere, works. ##### ENVIRONMENT * AWX version: Devel 3-10-21 ##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE Click Templates, select a template, and click Schedules. Click the checkbox next to one or more schedules and click Delete. Right away, click the browser's Back button (I was trying to mimic a user who accidentally deleted something and in a silly way, tries clicking back to see if that helps). You will notice a spinning circle on the page that will stay that way until you click another of the app's links. Clicking refresh doesn't work. ##### EXPECTED RESULTS Clicking Back after deleting would bring the user to that page, showing that whatever schedules had just been deleted were still deleted. ##### ACTUAL RESULTS The page went mostly blank and a reload circle spun and spun until I clicked one of the app's links to redirect the page. ##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ![Reload error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63685497/110692868-d30ef000-81b4-11eb-8d7e-0312cc0fa084.gif)</DESCRIPTION>
