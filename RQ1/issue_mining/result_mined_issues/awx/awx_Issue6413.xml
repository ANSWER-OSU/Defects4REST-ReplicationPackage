  <TITLE>Project Job Templates tab shouldn't allow creation of WFJTs</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report ##### SUMMARY Not necessarily a bug, but just &quot;too much functionality&quot;. When adding a Job Template within the context of the Project page, it automatically associates the project with the JT. This makes sense.

Steps: 1. Create a project 2. Visit that project's tab called &quot;Job Templates&quot; 3. Attempt to add a template</DESCRIPTION>
