  <TITLE>Implement `Replace` functionality for credential passwords</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Feature Idea ##### SUMMARY &lt;img width=&quot;517&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2020-06-04 at 2 43 46 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9889020/83798242-f9c25800-a671-11ea-8ab8-58b0583e82b7.png&quot;&gt; In the old UI, password fields in the credential subform are disabled on edit and we force the user to click this replace button in order to enable it and make a change. @wenottingham @trahman73 is this a UX pattern that we want to carry over to the new app? Right now the field looks like: &lt;img width=&quot;473&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2020-06-04 at 2 48 10 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9889020/83798579-75240980-a672-11ea-91fb-bb62d7743ead.png&quot;&gt; and the user can type in the input to overwrite: &lt;img width=&quot;482&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2020-06-04 at 2 48 18 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9889020/83798605-7ead7180-a672-11ea-8d79-b01312e2fe3c.png&quot;&gt; If we do want it - is it critical for an initial release?</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>Merge pull request #9208 from mabashian/job-output-search-2 Add support for filtering and pagination on job output SUMMARY link #6612 link #5906 This PR adds the ability to filter job events and also includes logic to handle fetching filtered job events across different pages. Note that the verbosity dropdown included in #5906 is not included in this work. I don't think that's possible without api changes. As part of this work, I converted JobOutput.jsx from a class based component to a functional component. I've tried my best to make sure that all existing functionality has remained the same by comparing the experience of this branch to devel. Like the old UI, the output filter is disabled while the job is running.

      <MESSAGE>Merge pull request #9368 from mabashian/7256-cred-password-replace Add support for replace/revert on secret credential fields SUMMARY link #7256 Note that this only applies to editing an existing credential. You should not see this button on fields when adding a new credential. When editing an existing credential the replace button should show up on fields where secret is true and the field has an existing value that is not an external credential. Examples: Fields with external credentials should look the same: Initially the button tooltip should say Replace. Clicking Replace will clear out the previously saved value and enable the form field: The tooltip will change to Revert. Clicking Revert will take the field back to it's original state. I also noticed a race condition which would result in the input fields (subform) not being populated due to the form rendering before the request(s) were completed. I fixed this.
