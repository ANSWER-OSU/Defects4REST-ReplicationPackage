  <TITLE>&quot;Type&quot; sort is extraneous in schedule tab for resources</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report ##### SUMMARY The default sort in the UI for schedules is &quot;Type&quot;. For example, with Job Templates, the type is &quot;Playbook Run&quot;. This sort makes sense for the main schedules view, `/schedules`, but doesn't make sense at all when dealing with tabs like Job Template &gt; Schedules. It's the default sort in that view, but doesn't do anything because all items in these sub-tabs are the same type. This issue is satisfied by removing &quot;Type&quot; from the sort choices for the Project &gt; schedule, Job template &gt; schedule, etc. views (there are more, this is not an exhaustive list). The default sort should also be set to &quot;Name&quot;, or something else if there is a more intuitive sort for that list.</DESCRIPTION>
