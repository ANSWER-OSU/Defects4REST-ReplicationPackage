  <TITLE>Remove URL params when closing modal/wizard</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report ##### SUMMARY Clean up URL params when closing a modal. See https://github.com/ansible/awx/pull/10215#issuecomment-845202406 for details/examples. Ideally, closing and re-opening a modal should bring it back up in a &quot;clean&quot; state, without filters/search/or pagination applied to any list within the modal. This might require a little brainstorming &amp; thinking through specific examples to be sure we get the behavior we want everywhere. What about clicking through steps in a wizard—should filters remain if the user navigates back to a previous step where filters were applied? ##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE Open any modal with a list of items. Run a filter on the list or change pagination options. Close the modal; the filters will remain in the URL params. Re-open the same modal, and the filters will still be applied (because they are read from the URL params) ##### EXPECTED RESULTS Closing and re-opening a modal should _probably_ bring it back up in a &quot;clean&quot; state, without filters/search/or pagination applied to any list within the modal.</DESCRIPTION>
