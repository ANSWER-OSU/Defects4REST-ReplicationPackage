  <TITLE>[DOCS] Add alt-text codeblock to Images for Userguide: main_menu.rst</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Please confirm the following - [X] I agree to follow this project's [code of conduct](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html). - [X] I have checked the [current issues](https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues) for duplicates. - [X] I understand that AWX is open source software provided for free and that I might not receive a timely response. - [X] I am **NOT** reporting a (potential) security vulnerability. (These should be emailed to `security@ansible.com` instead.) ### Bug Summary We need to add alt-text to images for accessibility purposes. See the syntax in the Expected Results below. ### AWX version latest ### Select the relevant components - [ ] UI - [ ] UI (tech preview) - [ ] API - [X] Docs - [ ] Collection - [ ] CLI - [ ] Other ### Installation method kubernetes ### Modifications no ### Ansible version _No response_ ### Operating system _No response_ ### Web browser _No response_ ### Steps to reproduce 1. Clone the AWX repo. 2. Navigate to the source files for the User Guide in GitHub at: https://github.com/ansible/awx/tree/devel/docs/docsite/rst/userguide (locally they should reside in ``/Users/you/awx/docs/docsite/rst/userguide``). 3. Open the main_menu.rst file to edit it. Search all image directives and place the `:alt:` code block beneath it. See syntax in Expected Results below. 4. Commit the changes, open a PR. ### Expected results The following codeblock added to each image with its specific descriptors filled in: ``` .. image:: ../common/images/image-filename.png :alt: Phrase that describes image ``` or ``` |Resource - alt text describing image| .. |Resource - alt text describing image| image:: ../common/images/image-filename.png :alt: Phrase that describes image ``` ### Actual results Some images don't have the alt text info in them. ### Additional information Example from Credentials section of the User Guide: ``` Add Team Permissions ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ To add permissions to a Team: 1. Click the **Add** button, which opens the Add Permissions Wizard. .. image:: ../common/images/teams-users-add-permissions-form.png :alt: Add Permissions Form ```</DESCRIPTION>

This is necessary as uploading files to DSV is not possible (and not meant to be) and files should be added base64 encoded. The commit is making sure to remain backward compatible (no secret decoding), as a default is supplied. This has been tested with DSV and works for secrets that are base64 encoded and secrets that are not base64 encoded (which is the default).

Make vault init more idempotent (#14664) Currently if you cleanup docker volume for vault and bring docker-compose development back up with vault enabled we will not initialize vault because the secret files still exist. This change will attempt to initialize vault reguardless and update the secret file if vault is initialized Remove unused methods we attach to user model (#14668) Update RBAC docs, remove unused get_permissions (#14492) * Update RBAC docs, remove unused get_permissions * Add back in section for get_roles_on_resource Upgrade doc requirements (#14669) * upgrade when pip compiling doc reqs * upgrade doc requirements allow pytest --migrations to succeed (#14663) * allow pytest --migrations to succeed * We actually subvert migrations from running in test via pytest.ini --no-migrations option. This has led to bit rot for the sqlite migrations happy path. This changeset pays off that tech debt and allows for an sqlite migration happy path. * This paves the way for programatic invocation of individual migrations and weaving of the creation of resources (i.e. Instance, Job Template, etc). With this, a developer can instantiate various database states, trigger a migration, assert the state of the db, and then have pytest rollback all of that. * I will note that in practice, running these migrations is dog shit slow BUT this work also opens up the possibility of saving and re-using sqlite3 database files. Normally, caching is not THE answer and causes more harm than good. But in this case, our migrations are mostly write-once (I say mostly because this change set violates that :) so cache invalidation isn't a major issue. * functional test for migrations on sqlite * We commonly subvert running migrations in test land. Test land uses sqlite. By not constantly exercising this code path it atrophies. The smoke test here is to continuously exercise that code path. * Add ci test to run migration tests separately, they take =~ 2-3 minutes each on my laptop. * The smoke tests also serves as an example of how to write migration tests. * run migration tests in ci Fix awx collection publishing on galaxy (#14642) --location (-L) parameter will prompt curl to submit a new request if the URL is a redirect.

Signed-off-by: Andrew Austin &lt;aaustin@redhat.com&gt; * Refactor docker-compose vault for TLS cert auth Add TLS configuration to the docker-compose Vault configuration and use that method by default in vault plumbing.

We rely on the POST key in the OPTIONS response to determine the fields to export for a resource. The POST key is not present if a user does NOT have create privileges. * Fixed up forwarding all headers from the API server back to the test code. This was causing a problem in awxkit code that checks for allowed HTTP Verbs in the headers. refactor awxkit import code * Move awxkit import code into a pytest fixture to better control when the import happens * Ensure /awx_devel/awxkit is added to sys path before awxkit import runs Fix twilio_backend.py to send SMS to multiple destinations.
