  <TITLE>Expose the SCM Branch name in the playbook environment</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Feature Idea ##### SUMMARY Today if I launch a job and put `foobar` in the &quot;SCM Branch&quot; field, the corresponding commit hash is exposed as `awx_project_revision` but the proper human readable name of my branch/tag `foobar` remains inaccessible. A use case to access this information is to put it in configuration files (eg. in a UI to document which version of the platform was deployed). Many more can be envisioned too. I see two paths for implementation: * Change the `awx_project_revision` content to keep the SCM Branch as it was in the input (stop turning it into a hash) * Expose this into a variable of its own, like `awx_project_scm_branch`</DESCRIPTION>
