  <TITLE>Notifications - missing hosts with webhook notification</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report ##### SUMMARY We have around 400 hosts in the inventory, however, the notification webhook endpoint receives notification about only around 40-50 hosts. (Sometimes it's working fine reporting all the hosts.) ##### ENVIRONMENT * AWX version: 6.1.0.0 (Same problem with 6.0.0.0) * AWX install method: docker on linux (official image from docker hub) * Ansible version: 2.8.2 * Operating System: Centos7 * Web Browser: Chrome ##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE - Create a webhook notification - Start a job (or job-flow), enable notifications. ##### EXPECTED RESULTS Report from all the hosts in JSON format ##### ACTUAL RESULTS Most of the times only partial host list in the report, sometimes full list. Differs in a job-flow, some jobs reporting about all hosts, some only about a few) Workflow with 2 jobs: Number of hosts, on which the job ran (reported in AWX): 438 Number of hosts reported on the webhook script: 53 ##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I also have the same problem with 6.0.0.0 and 6.1.0.0 I tried with different users, with standalon jobs or woth flows, also with different playbooks, the problem looks pretty consistent.
