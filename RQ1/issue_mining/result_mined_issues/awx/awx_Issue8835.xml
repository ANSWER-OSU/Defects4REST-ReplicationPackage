  <TITLE>[ui_next] Can add team permissions to team</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report ##### SUMMARY Can add team permissions to team. This menu is for granting access to a team. Granting a team access to another team is extremely confusing, and there’s no articulable guidance about the nuances and hazards of doing that. It would be best to not present this menu for teams, and assume that granting access ONLY means granting users access to the team. &lt;img width=&quot;629&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2020-12-10 at 5 29 53 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12446869/101837632-587af980-3b0d-11eb-8307-16a4a1516ee2.png&quot;&gt; ##### ENVIRONMENT * AWX version:12/10</DESCRIPTION>
