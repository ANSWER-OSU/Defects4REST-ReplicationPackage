  <TITLE>Proposal, Add back Custom virtual env fields in modules</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Feature Idea ##### SUMMARY Proposal: Return the code to have custom virtual environments in their applicable modules that were removed in the update to 17 -&gt; 18. The reason being is that there are tower users that use awx.awx because it contains the latest updates and feature improvements, the vast majority still work on Tower 3.7.x,3.8.x. These would updated and noted in the docs that it is meant for older versions of awx, and will fail on newer. The expectation is that the options when used with the wrong version would fail, and it would be on the users to use the right one. I also thing putting depreciated on custom virtual environment options would be appropriate. The idea is to make it so that users can use the same features and upgrades done to the collection regardless of the version they are using, and put the onus on them to use the correct ones that correspond to their instance. I would do the PR for this, but wanted to gather feedback before submitting it.</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Merge pull request #10097 from sean-m-sullivan/devel add custom_venv for backward compatibility SUMMARY As per #10055 , this is the proposal to add back custom virtual environments to the modules. With the understanding that they will not be tested. But to allow users of Ansible Tower 3.8 the ability to use newer features and bugfixes in awx.awx as applicable, without restorting to backporting these removals. Would expect these to remain for a time after Tower moves to Execution environments as teams/companies adopt the next version of tower.
