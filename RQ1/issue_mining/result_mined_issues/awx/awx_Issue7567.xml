      <MESSAGE>Merge pull request #10047 from sean-m-sullivan/org_label add org search to labels SUMMARY After having an issue with labels I saw that orgs were referenced, Remembering #7567 implemented the code to do the search for orgs so you can search for labels within an org, Tests include creating the same named label in two orgs, and the search not erroring out that it found two labels of that name.
