  <TITLE>CLI: list should not include --id because it is confusing and that is what get is for</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Bug Report ##### SUMMARY &lt;!-- Briefly describe the problem. --&gt; It was discussed that the fact that `awx &lt;resource&gt; list` accepts `--id` as argument is confusing, because most other actions take it as a positional argument. In help text is shows up like this: ``` --id INTEGER only list instances with the specified id ``` But this only gets one item, which is the same as `awx &lt;resource&gt; get &lt;id&gt;`. RESOLUTION: Remove `--id` from `list` commands</DESCRIPTION>
