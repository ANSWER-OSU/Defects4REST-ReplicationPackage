    <MESSAGE>Merge pull request #10090 from rebeccahhh/custom_venv_command add a new awx-manage command `custom_venvs` add an awx-manage command that gets pip freeze data from custom_venv and outputs to command line stdout SUMMARY part of #7062 - this command is a glorified pip freeze + some extra stuff, people could navigate to each of their custom virtual environments themselves and run a pip freeze, but this allows them to not, and everyone likes their life to be easier. The extra stuff allows users to see the connections that their existing virtual envs have in awx to things like organizations, jobs, inventory updates, and projects. ISSUE TYPE Feature Pull Request COMPONENT NAME API AWX VERSION awx: 19.1.0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION This is built off of existing code and there is a line that gets custom venv paths from the settings module, that line does not seem to be working. I have written around that but want to make a note of it.
