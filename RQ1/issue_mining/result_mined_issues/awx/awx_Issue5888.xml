  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Feature Idea ##### SUMMARY &lt;img width=&quot;1680&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2020-02-11 at 10 52 05 AM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9889020/74253057-91afc680-4cbc-11ea-88a3-8045e0fc65ac.png&quot;&gt; We'll need to support a few different things here: 1) The schedule list itself (should be able to re-use #4959 with a different endpoint) 2) Add schedule form (should be able to re-use #5864 with a different endpoint) 3) Edit schedule form (should be able to re-use #5865 with a different endpoint) 4) Schedule details view (should be able to re-use #5859 with a different endpoint) Going to mark this as blocked until #4959, #5859, #5864, and #5865 are done.</DESCRIPTION>
