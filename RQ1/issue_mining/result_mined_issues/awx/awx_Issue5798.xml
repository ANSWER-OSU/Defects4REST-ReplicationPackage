  <TITLE>Have a user customizable banner for the installation</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>##### ISSUE TYPE - Feature Idea ##### SUMMARY Many users have different AWX deployments - either deployments for different users (network, storage) or different environments (dev, test, prod). A user who is using multiple AWX deployments regularly does not have visual notification of &quot;where&quot; they are, which could lead to confusion and potentially launching automation in an unexpected location / on the wrong set of devices - the only distinguishing item would be the URL. This could be solved by having a admin-customizable banner that provides information on what environment/deployment you are currently on. (Some users have solved this by hacking a different background color into each environment, but a banner or similar item would presumably be less intrusive than adding theming support.)</DESCRIPTION>
