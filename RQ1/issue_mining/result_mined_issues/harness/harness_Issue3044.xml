  <TITLE>Show who &quot;owns&quot; or &quot;enabled&quot; the repo</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Since the repo &quot;owner&quot; who activated the repo in Drone grants their credentials to be used (and thus embedded for things like accessing dependencies in private repos), Drone should show who added the repo to it. The problem is that when people leave organizations or revoke their access to Drone, it's not transparent why builds stopped from looking at Drone. If the owner's handle + icon was visible then it would be easy to understand &quot;oh this person left so I need to chown&quot; this repo (the shortfall of oauth apps [until GH Apps is a thing](https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/2422)).</DESCRIPTION>
