  <TITLE>SSH keys at user level?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>This comment pretty much sums it up: &gt; Yes, I took that generated key, removed it from the 'deployment keys' on Github and added it to our 'automation github user'. However, as we have various projects with private dependencies, it gets quite cumbersome to repeat this for every new project. I think we have a couple of options **Option 1** We can allow the repository public and private key to be updated via the website (they are currently readonly). If we do this, do we need to add/replace the public key in GitHub? **Option 2** We can add a public key at the GitHub user account. We can add a checkbox on the repository screen that instructs the build to use the key at the user level. Option 1 is probably the easiest</DESCRIPTION>
