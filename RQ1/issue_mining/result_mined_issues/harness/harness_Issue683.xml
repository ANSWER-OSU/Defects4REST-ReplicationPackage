  <TITLE>Prevent build concurrency?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Is there a way to prevent builds from occurring concurrently? I have code that I need to test, but it can't be run at the same time. Currently drone is building the master branch, and a merged hotfix branch at the same time, and develop appears to be queued (hotfix was merged into develop as well). I've only ever seen drone run two builds at the same time, but is there a way to drop it to one for a project or the whole install?</DESCRIPTION>
