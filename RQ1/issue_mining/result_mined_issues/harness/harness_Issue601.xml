  <TITLE>Networking restart problem on CentOS with SystemD</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Running under Centos7, systemd via service drone start. I've been experiencing an ongoing issue of droned starting up but failing to acquire its network port (thus, netstat -an | grep LIST shows the port isn't up). This is especially prevalent when trying to restart the daemon. A rule was added to firewalld to allow all traffic to and from port 8282 (where my drone server is configured). I've tried these things: 1. stopping firewalld before starting drone 2. Stopping docker then restarting drone 3. Waiting for all ports using 8282 to complete their TIME_WAIT Edit: last output I pasted here was a red-herring, I had a bad logging option in the toml. The networking restart problem is still an intermittent issue.</DESCRIPTION>
