  <TITLE>Drone task branch matching</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>When defining a drone task to have a branch condition such as: ``` branch: - snapshot/* ``` There seems to be a bug such that it doesn't match as expected (unless I'm missing something). Hence, a branch like this matches fine (**success**): ``` snapshot/RP-1915 ``` But a branch like this does not (**fail**): ``` snapshot/any-text/RP-1915 ``` I would think the wildcard glob would match both?!</DESCRIPTION>
