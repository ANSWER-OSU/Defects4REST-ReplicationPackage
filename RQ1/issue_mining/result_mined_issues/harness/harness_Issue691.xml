  <TITLE>Add install section to drone.yml</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Currently, installation and execution of tests is mixed in the `script` section of `drone.yml`. This should be split up in `installation` and `script` for two reasons: 1. By separation of installation from tests it documents better what is going on. People can see your test procedure by just looking at the correct part of the file 2. It allows for **Docker caching**. Drone could leverage Dockers builtin caching for its installation instructions, minimising the traffic and time needed to set up the build image. Only the `script` part should always be un-cached and thus run every time.</DESCRIPTION>
