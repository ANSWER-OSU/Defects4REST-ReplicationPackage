  <TITLE>on_success: after_failure</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>In some other CI systems it's possible to set up notifications to only go out in the event of failure, or after a failure has been resolved. So `on_success: after_failure` would look at the previous build, see if it was a failure, and if so send a notification.</DESCRIPTION>
