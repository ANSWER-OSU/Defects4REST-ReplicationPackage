  <TITLE>Pull requests with more than 1 commit break the tests</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Sending a suggested change on #911 break the test because there is more than 1 commit on the pull request. This made me open another pull request #932, cherry pick only the last change. This made the test pass. Is this really how it should work? Here is the test result for que PR with 2 commits: http://test.drone.io/github.com/drone/drone/check_presence_socat_anywhere_in_path/0d36b85e65b51f9820825de360f21b56c0ab7599</DESCRIPTION>
