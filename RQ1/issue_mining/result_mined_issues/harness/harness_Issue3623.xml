  <TITLE>[harness/harness:unstable-uiv2] Artifacts registry moved to Harness Enterprise?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>First, thanks for this great open source product: its [landing page](https://www.harness.io/open-source) and the [roadmap](https://developer.harness.io/roadmap/#platform) made me test your product :) However, I wonder about the future of **Harness Open Source** by looking at your [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/harness/harness/tags) activities: - `harness:latest` and `harness:test-unstable` have not been updated for 3 months. - `harness/harness:unstable-uiv2` is actively updated, and when I tested, I was surprised by this message when trying to use `Artifacts` or any other module than `Repositories`: _**Upgrade to Harness Enterprise** to access Artifacts_. ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61d63a36-bbf5-4a34-ab91-d2c1e39aba2e) Could you confirm that the current features of Harness Open Source like `Artifacts` and `Gitspaces` will be included in the future stable versions ? Hopefully you temporarily removed all the features except `Repositories` because `harness/harness:unstable-uiv2` is still unstable</DESCRIPTION>
