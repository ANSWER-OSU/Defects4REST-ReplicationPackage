  <TITLE>make fails to find &quot;rice&quot; in the path and the build exits</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The Makefile has a rice target: ``` rice: go get github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice/rice go build github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice/rice ``` The make failed because this wasn't in my path on the system. My solution was to add one more line to the rice dep: ``` go install github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice/rice ``` which placed the binary in my $GOPATH/bin and thus the build could continue.</DESCRIPTION>
