  <TITLE>long time before build starts</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello, Help on this would be appreciated. It takes around 15 (sometimes more) minutes to see status being changed from STARTED (into building) and to see build logs in a browser screen. There is nothing in between showing what is going on (cannot see anything in logs neither). If rebuild is triggered, it takes as much long. Did pull all images needed for build .... also could notice image being build at very beginning but not having tag yet. if I would stop drone process, image would get a tag name. It is running on amazon m1.small. Docker info: Images: 150 Storage Driver: btrfs Execution Driver: native-0.2 Kernel Version: 3.13.0-36-generic Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS WARNING: No swap limit support ubuntu@ip-172-31-36-122:~$ thank you in advance</DESCRIPTION>
