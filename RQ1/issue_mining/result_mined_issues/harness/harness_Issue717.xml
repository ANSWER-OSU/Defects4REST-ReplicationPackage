  <TITLE>Broaden glob support for artifact specification</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I'm using Drone.io (Free) for a Go program that's being built for multiple platforms and want all resulting executables saved as build artifacts. Generated artifacts are laid out as follows: ``` $ tree . |-- darwin-386 | `-- foo |-- darwin-amd64 | `-- foo |-- linux-386 | `-- foo |-- linux-amd64 | `-- foo |-- windows-386 | `-- foo.exe `-- windows-amd64 `-- foo.exe 6 directories, 6 files ``` A concise glob to catch them all in a single line would be `{linux,darwin,windows}-{amd64,386}/foo*`. Doing an `ls` with this pattern returns all files as expected. Shells used to verify: - `GNU bash, version 4.3.30(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0)` - `zsh 5.0.6 (x86_64-apple-darwin13.3.0)` When using this pattern as input in Drone's settings, my files are not being picked up. I cross-checked and added the files one-by-one which worked out seamlessly. So I request support for full Bash style globs, not only `*` (at least that's the only operator mentioned in [the docs](http://docs.drone.io/artifacts.html)). I'd be happy to assist in adding this but had difficulties finding the implementation for artifact &quot;lookup&quot;. Please give me pointers.</DESCRIPTION>
