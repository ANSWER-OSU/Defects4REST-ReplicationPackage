  <TITLE>What is the correct image prefix and when did it change from &quot;app/&quot; to &quot;dokku/&quot; or vice versa?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Running into issues like these: ``` Unable to find image 'dokku/thereponame' locally Pulling repository dokku/thereponame 2014/04/15 07:30:37 HTTP code: 404 ``` All my images were created by dokku 0.2.1 as &quot;app/thereponame&quot; until a recent dokku upgrade to the master branch, after which they are being created as &quot;dokku/thereponame&quot;. Plugins seems to be either looking for &quot;dokku/thereponame&quot; or &quot;app/thereponame&quot; depending on how long it was since they were updated.</DESCRIPTION>
