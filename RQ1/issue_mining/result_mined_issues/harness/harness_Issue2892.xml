  <TITLE>Docs: single machine setup guide and DRONE_AGENTS_DISABLED missing</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Since the docs were updated for Drone 1.x, the instructions for a single machine setup without a runner/agent is missing. I asked in Gitter around 2 months ago, if the setup is still valid and will be supported in the future, what has been confirmed. Today, after I updated my Drone installation and all my Builds were stuck at Pending, I read the [FAQ](https://discourse.drone.io/t/builds-are-stuck-in-pending-status/4437) about this problem and wondered about the statement under **Verify Runner Installation**, which, in my opinion, clearly says **&quot;You need a runner&quot;**. After the irritation I found the solutions to my problem in the changelog (`DRONE_AGENTS_DISABLED=true`, which is not documented too btw.), but nevertheless I would be great to have this in the documentation. I would be happy to make a PR for this, but unfortunately the current docs are not public yet.</DESCRIPTION>
