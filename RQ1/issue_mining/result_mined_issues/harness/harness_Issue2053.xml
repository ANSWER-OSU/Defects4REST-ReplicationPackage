  <TITLE>ability to specify platform requirement in matrix builds</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I need to build apps one per platform (arm,x86). Right now even if I run agents on multiple platforms I cannot override platform requirement using matrix variable (as well as plugin image names) I am migrating from TeamCity where I can create separate build configurations with corresponding arch requirements. I understand that TeamCity is java and all the plugins just work so it is a bit simpler.</DESCRIPTION>
