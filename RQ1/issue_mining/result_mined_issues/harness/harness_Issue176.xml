  <TITLE>Fail Started / Pending builds when Drone is restarted</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>My drone container was killed during a build. Now the build in question is in a perpetual &quot;running&quot; state. Depending on the implementation, I think there should either be a timeout in general, or in-progress jobs should be marked fail after a restart, if there is no way for them to be completed anyway.</DESCRIPTION>
