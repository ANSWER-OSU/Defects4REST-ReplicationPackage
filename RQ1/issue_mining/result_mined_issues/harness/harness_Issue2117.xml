  <TITLE>Documentation: How to know which agent runs which build</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, We use Drone on multiple machines with different hardware capabilities. I'd like to know which builds runs on which agent, for debugging purpose. Unfortunately I couldn't find anything in the docs, in GitHub issues or on [stackoverflow/drone.io](stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/drone.io). 1. Is there a way to print the agent's name? There does not seem to be an env variable for that. Otherwise is there a way to define custom per-agent variables, like asked in drone/drone#1808? If not, is there a way to get this information by ssh-ing on the Drone server (or agents) after builds are complete and containers deleted? 2. I'd like to improve Drone documentation by answering this question, because I think it's a legitimate one :)</DESCRIPTION>
