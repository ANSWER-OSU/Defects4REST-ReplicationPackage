  <TITLE>cron: cannot find commit</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello! Drone seems to have an issue trying to run cron jobs on deleted repositories. I'm running Drone against Gitea, both in Docker (on CapRover). I deleted two repos, then synced Drone to my repos and since then I get the following errors in my Drone docker logs: `branch=main cron=4 error=Not Found level=warning msg=cron: cannot find commit repo=org/deleted repo` I have also created cron jobs for other repos that haven't been deleted and they show the same error Cron jobs have been created with the CLI and show on the GUI. The build runs properly when a commit is done on the new repo or when manually triggered from Drone UI Thanks,</DESCRIPTION>
