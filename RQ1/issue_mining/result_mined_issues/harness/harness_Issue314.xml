  <TITLE>No build force option; was: list of commits is not shown after adding the repository</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I did a clean install on Ubuntu as instructed at https://github.com/drone/drone#setup, added my github and bitbucket applications tokens/secrets and linked my accounts. After this I added a public repository from both these providers... add is succesful, but the list of commits remains empty. Looking at the page, there seems to be a websocket that is made (upgrades and 200s) but the refresh button still has the 'hide' css class. I also pulled most of the images, such as base, and build engines, to no avail. What could it be missing? No error messages are given. Correction: no build can be triggered from the admin. It seems a forced-update or change to the repo is needed before a build starts.</DESCRIPTION>
