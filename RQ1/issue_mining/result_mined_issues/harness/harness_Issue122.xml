  <TITLE>DRONE_BRANCH and DRONE_PR env variables</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>My build script handles branches differently based on their name. drone.io has the env variable DRONE_BRANCH that tells my script what branch it is building, but I am unable to find anything like that in drone/drone. What should I do to determine current branch?</DESCRIPTION>
