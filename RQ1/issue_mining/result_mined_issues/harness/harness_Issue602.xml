  <TITLE>Gravatar for commit author - BitBucket</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>There's no gravatar in commits for BitBucket. It seems to be assumed that `author` from BitBucket post-commit hook is email of author. It's not, it's just username. Email could be obtained by parsing `raw_author` field. [1] There's also no `RawAuthor` field in `Commit` struct in drone/go-bitbucket [2], which would be needed to get access to `raw_author` field from BitBucket. Are there any disadvantages of this solution? If not I'll gladly make the PR :) [1] https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/POST+hook+management [2] https://github.com/drone/go-bitbucket/blob/master/bitbucket/brokers.go#L221</DESCRIPTION>
