  <TITLE>Update `lib/pq` to new(er) version</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Drone's Postgres driver, `lib/pq` is on [v1.1.0](https://github.com/lib/pq/releases/tag/v1.1.0), which was released in April 2019. https://github.com/harness/drone/blob/master/go.mod#L45 Postgres 12 was released in [October 2019](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/12.0/). This means the last major Postgres version that `lib/pq` v1.1.0 had official compatibility with was Postgres 11. I'm requesting `lib/pq` be updated to something newer. I read the [contributing doc](https://github.com/harness/drone/blob/master/.github/contributing.md#dependencies) about dependencies. I don't have a target version in mind, but I would like to upgrade to a newer Postgres version knowing that the driver was written after that version of Postgres came out. They're currently at [v1.10.7](https://github.com/lib/pq/releases/tag/v1.10.7), but I'm not sure if you want to jump that far forward. For example: - v1.2.0 dropped tested support for Postgres &lt; 9.4 - v1.4.0 bumped oldest supported Go version to 1.13</DESCRIPTION>
