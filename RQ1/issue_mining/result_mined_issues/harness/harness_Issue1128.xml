  <TITLE>Retry logic if a worker is down</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>When you add multiple Docker daemons from multiple hosts, if one of the hosts drop out you end up with a 1/n build failures due to time out. It would be ideal, if there were retry logic after the time out to drop the build back on the queue. Additional optimization would be to keep track of workers that are unresponsive and eject them from the pool. Just to save on build startup time.</DESCRIPTION>
