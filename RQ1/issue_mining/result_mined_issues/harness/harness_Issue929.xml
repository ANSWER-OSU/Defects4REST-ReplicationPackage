  <TITLE>Encrypted values / variables - and Shared values</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Currently (I believe) there is no way to inject information securely into the build. Use case: I'm using Drone.io (open source) to run tests against chef cookbooks. With an internal berkshelf server, I need to deploy a key into the container so it can communicate with the internal berkshelf server. If I configure this through the web ui there are 2 problems: 1. The value is plain text / can be read by anyone? 2. I have to set this value on every repository - An organisation level, or user level setting would be more desirable to apply to all builds.</DESCRIPTION>
