  <TITLE>Post-activation plugin (PR to automatically add a .drone.yml)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We should add the ability to specify plugins post-activation (and maybe post-deactivation) and perhaps after other system events as well. An example for this sort of plugin would be opening a pull request to automatically add a `.drone.yml` or badge to the `README.md` file. The reason this makes sense as a plugin is because Drone supports multiple remote systems (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc) and each one has slightly different APIs and processes that need to be followed. Bitbucket, for example, requires Mercurial integration as well as Git. By pushing this functionality to a plugin, instead of a core Drone feature, it gives us flexibility and allows teams to customize this functionality to meet their specific organizational needs. It also means it can be turned on or off by the system admin. Or maybe you want the `.drone.yml` auto-populated with common commands or notification settings for your org -- you could alter the plugin to do so.</DESCRIPTION>
