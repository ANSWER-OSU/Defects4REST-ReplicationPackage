  <TITLE>Vulnerability of dependency &quot;golang.org/x/net&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello, we are a team researching the dependency management mechanism of Golang. During our analysis, we came across your project and noticed that it contains a vulnerability ([[CVE-2022-41723](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vvpx-j8f3-3w6h)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vvpx-j8f3-3w6h)). In your project, the golang.org/x/net package is being used at version v0.0.0-20201202161906-c7110b5ffcbb, but the patched version is v0.7.0. To fix the vulnerability, we recommend modifying the go.mod file to update the version to v0.7.0. Thank you for your attention to this matter.</DESCRIPTION>
