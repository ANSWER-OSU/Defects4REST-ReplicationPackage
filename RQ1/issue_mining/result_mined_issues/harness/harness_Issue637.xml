  <TITLE>Team Settings, forbidden access?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I just set up a fresh Drone.io instance and added a new team. At some point, when I clicked on &quot;Team Settings&quot; from the team-specific dashboard, I get a &quot;Forbidden&quot; message and a &quot;400: Bad Request&quot; response. This seemed to happen out of the blue. I installed Drone.io using a Docker container which I believe installs the latest version of Drone. Is there something that might cause this? Is there a way for me to delete the team given I no longer have access?</DESCRIPTION>
