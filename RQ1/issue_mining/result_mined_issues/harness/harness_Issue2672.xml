  <TITLE>Disable Pull requests and forks by default</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I think enabling pipelines for pull requests and forks by default is not good: - You need to disable them in the UI every time you add a repo OR you must disable them in pipeline configuration if you don't want to see failed builds because pull requests and forks cannot access secrets by default (Which is good) - Since any user can create a pull request or a fork it might be a possible security risk if some party starts creating these rapidly to increase load in the Drone server (DDOS)</DESCRIPTION>
