  <TITLE>Jsonnet extension not working</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I have started the Jsonnet extension as specified in https://docs.drone.io/extend/config/jsonnet/. Drone server however does not seem to connect the extension (DRONE_YAML_ENDPOINT and DRONE_YAML_SECRET are specified) and connectivity is tested to work using `nc` inside the Drone server container. Drone attempts to find the YAML but does not contact the extension: ``` {&quot;commit&quot;:&quot;7a59cce5230cc14bb0e05b0df90f3850c3ae6008&quot;,&quot;error&quot;:&quot;Not Found&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;push&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;warning&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;trigger: cannot find yaml&quot;,&quot;ref&quot;:&quot;refs/heads/test&quot;,&quot;repo&quot;:&quot;xxx/xxx&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2019-03-04T08:30:34+02:00&quot;} ``` Tested with `1.0.0-rc.5` and `latest`.</DESCRIPTION>
