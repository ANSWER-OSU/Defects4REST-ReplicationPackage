  <TITLE>Ability to enable open registration on a per-plugin basis</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We use both GitHub.com and a private instance of GitHub Enterprise. For our GHE users, we would be happy to allow open registration, i.e. anyone with a GHE account can log in. For GitHub.com however, we would need to restrict which users can use Drone. Currently open registration is a global option affecting all remote plugins. I'd like to be able to enable/disable open registration for specific remotes.</DESCRIPTION>
