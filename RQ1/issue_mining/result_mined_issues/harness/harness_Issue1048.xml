  <TITLE>dumb terminal</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>As discussed on gitter and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30674922/ my builds need access to a tty (even though it is not used). It appears that passing `-t` to docker should make this work. I'd be happy to test a self-built cut of drone with this change if that helps. Just let me know the commit to cherry pick on top of the last stable (or give me a branch that I can build... assuming you don't have a CI job for `.deb` snapshot files, which would be awesome btw!)</DESCRIPTION>
