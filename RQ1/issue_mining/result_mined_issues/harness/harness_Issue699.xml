  <TITLE>Deploy to multiple targets of the same</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We're deploying via git using the new when: branch:master but would like to deploy via git to other endpoints for other branches. I could not find any documentation and looking at the code it seems like there could be only one deploy target per service. We're using the following code: ``` deploy: git: target: OMITTED branch: master force: false when: branch: master ``` and would like something like: ``` deploy: git: target: A DIFFERENT OMITTED branch: develop force: false when: branch: develop ``` for the same project. Is this possible?</DESCRIPTION>
