  <TITLE>Feature Request - Implement Catlight.io protocol</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Heya, I recently discovered a CI monitor called Catlight that is really cool and allows communication amongst the team. It implements a new protocol that aims to replace the cc.xml from cruise control. It would be quite nice if this protocol would be implemented in Drone. More information is https://blog.catlight.io/post/158337666873/open-protocol-for-integration-with-continuous</DESCRIPTION>
