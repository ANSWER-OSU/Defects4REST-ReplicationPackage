  <TITLE>Button to cancel a build</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Some feedback from one of our internal pilots: ``` (...) there should be a cancel button for a build, especially if a build hangs up. ``` We've experienced builds hanging up randomly, but can't reproduce it at the moment. Once it happens, only restarting Drone helps. We are working on reproducing it.</DESCRIPTION>
