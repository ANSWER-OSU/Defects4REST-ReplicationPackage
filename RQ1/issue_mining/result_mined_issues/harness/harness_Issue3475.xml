  <TITLE>Drone pipeline converter cache/memorizer?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I can't find anything related to pipeline cache in Drone docs but it seems there is such thing. I'm using a conversion extension (starlark - external one). When I update it's components Drone does not apply it in the pipelines. It's using the older version that was built by the extension before the change. It works if i trigger a different pipeline or just restart the drone server. Is it possible to force Drone to parse pipeline every time even if there is no change in the file (I mean the main .drone.yml/.drone.star)?</DESCRIPTION>
