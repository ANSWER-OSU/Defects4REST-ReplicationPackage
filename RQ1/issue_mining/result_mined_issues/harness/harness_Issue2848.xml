  <TITLE>documentation not up to date/right</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The [documentation on cloning](https://docker-runner.docs.drone.io/configuration/cloning/) is wrong. It says to use the alpine:git image for cloning. This image doesn't exist. Also, a `go build` won't work by default on `golang` image because the drone workspace is on `/drone/src` volume and the GOPATH in the `golang` image points to `/go`. So, it clones a Go project to `/drone/src` which is outside GOPATH. And the build will fail because it can't get the deps right. I guess the solution would be to have a Go project using modules. I haven't tried yet.</DESCRIPTION>
