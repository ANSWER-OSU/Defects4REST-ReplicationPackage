  <TITLE>Failure to create build container with Drone 0.3.0 on Docker 1.7</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Docker 1.7 came out. Something about that broke Drone's ability to publish built images to Docker Hub after a successful build. So, I figured I'll just upgrade to 1.7 on my build machine to see if that fixes the problem with pushing to Docker Hub. But now, builds don't even start. I just get this error: ``` Error: Failed to create build container. Internal Server Error ``` which seems to come from this line: https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/90de72aacc9502d1fe454c00f9e7d18124b1705a/shared/build/build.go#L394 Any thoughts?</DESCRIPTION>
