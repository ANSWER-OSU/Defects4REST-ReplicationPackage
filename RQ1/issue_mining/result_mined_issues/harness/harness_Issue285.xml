  <TITLE>More descriptive fail build messages.</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello. I'm using private drone deployment and started to test it a little. When my app is failing to build I only get message: &quot;HTTP code: 404&quot; Which is not descriptive enough to track this problem. Is there possibility to get whole building logs? Are they saved somewhere on server? Anyway, I think this message should tell more about problem. At least URL should be included, right?</DESCRIPTION>
