  <TITLE>Configure S3 with v4 sign</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>v4 is more secure, for example by removing functions such as md5. And the new aws s3 region only supports v4 signatures. go already has a number of mature v4 sign repositories, such as https://github.com/smarty-archives/go-aws-auth, etc. I hope this can save your workload. Thank you very much for bringing us such a good product.</DESCRIPTION>
