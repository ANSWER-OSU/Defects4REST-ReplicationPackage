  <TITLE>Disabling a repo should remove hooks and SSH keys; reactivating it should re-instate hooks and SSH keys</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Currently, disabling a repository (using the CLI) removes the SSH key stored in GitHub against that repo, but it doesn't remove the Drone web hook. Conversely, re-activating a repo after it has been disabled does not add back the SSH key. I would expect that hooks and the SSH key would be removed and added back when repositories are disabled or reactivated.</DESCRIPTION>
