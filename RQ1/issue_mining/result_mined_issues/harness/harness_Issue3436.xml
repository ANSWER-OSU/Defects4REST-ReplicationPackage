  <TITLE>How can I backup my repositories?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I work in a company that doesn't use any versioning services because they are web based, I discovered Gitness these days and I need to make backups of project files to an internal server, how can I get the folders where the repository files are? I made a docker-compose.yaml so I could use gitness. ![image](https://github.com/harness/gitness/assets/47448206/551e6066-68fe-4244-b70e-b38c9bbfd465) I tried using the docker cp command but it did basically what docker-compose.yaml did. I'm new to docker.</DESCRIPTION>
