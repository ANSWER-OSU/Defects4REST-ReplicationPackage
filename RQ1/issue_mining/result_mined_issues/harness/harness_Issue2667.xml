  <TITLE>Pipeline hangs when trigger.status is failure</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>problem with build hanging when pipeline dependency graph is defined, where the final node in the graph should only execute on failure (below). this was discussed in the comments of #2553 ```test kind: pipeline name: greeting steps: - name: en image: alpine:3.8 commands: - echo hello - echo world - sleep 10 - exit 1 --- kind: pipeline name: saludo steps: - name: es image: alpine:3.8 commands: - echo hola - echo mundo --- kind: pipeline name: salutation steps: - name: fr image: alpine:3.8 commands: - echo bonjour - echo monde - echo $DRONE_BUILD_STATUS trigger: status: + - failure depends_on: - greeting - saludo ```</DESCRIPTION>
