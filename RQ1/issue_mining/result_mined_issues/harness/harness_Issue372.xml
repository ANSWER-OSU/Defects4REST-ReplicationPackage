  <TITLE>Unable to run grep?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>This is weird, I have a .drone.yml as follows ``` image: myimage script: - cp -r /var/cache/drone/src/github.com/myuser/repo/* /srv - rm /tmp/salt.log || true - salt-call state.highstate &gt; /tmp/salt.log - cat /tmp/salt.log - grep &quot;Failed: 0&quot; /tmp/salt.log ``` When it builds, the grep just never runs, ever. The logic doesn't run and the command doesn't get echo'd out to the log. I took the grep statement and put it into a bash script, and it gets executed without a problem. As soon as I add grep to any line, it no longer runs. For instance, cat /tmp/salt.log | grep hi, would cause the entire command not to run.</DESCRIPTION>
