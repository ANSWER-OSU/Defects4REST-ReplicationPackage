  <TITLE>Drone using outdated docker images</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>It looks like Drone isn't pulling in new versions of docker images when one is available. I haven't inspected the code yet, but I suspect that Drone simply runs `docker run`, which does download the image if missing, but doesn't download a new image if one is already available. Instead, it should first `docker pull` before running the container.</DESCRIPTION>
