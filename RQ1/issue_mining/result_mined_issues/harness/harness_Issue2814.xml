  <TITLE>missing /api/info/queue endpoint documentation</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I'm thinking about how to set drone Docker workers to autoscale inside our Mesos/Marathon/Metronome cluster which isn't covered in the &quot;offical&quot; autoscaler &amp; noticed it seems to have `/api/info/queue` endpoint that provides the needed info about the build queue - I found it referenced in a few closed tickets about it's creation but no documentation about it or any `/api/info` Is this endpoint still valid in 1.0 API? if so shouldn't it be documented?</DESCRIPTION>
