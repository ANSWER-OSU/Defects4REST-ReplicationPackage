  <TITLE>Safari 8.0 OAuth Login and Cookie Settings</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Whenever I try to log in to drone using Safari, I get redirected to GitHub to log in, type in my name and password, and then get an error message from GitHub. It doesn't appear to redirect back to drone. However, I'm already logged in to GitHub and using it. My only guess is an issue with redirects or cookies.</DESCRIPTION>
