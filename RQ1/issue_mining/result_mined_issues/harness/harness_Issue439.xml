  <TITLE>GitHub Release Plugin</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>We've started to do more and more publishing of (mostly Go binaries) via Github releases. Right now the process is `make release` to put a bunch of release artifacts in a folder (e.g. `release/`) and then run a script that creates a Github release and uploads the contents of this directory. I think we could turn this into a fairly generic drone publish plugin. Configuration options: - `script`: list of commands (or a single command?) to run to build a release - `dir`: directory to find release artifacts after script is run - `token`: Github token to use to interact with the Releases API. - `version_file`: defaults to VERSION at the root of the repository - `branch`: restrict to this branch Example: if we were etcd and we wanted to produce their releases (https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases) the config would look like: ``` publish: github: script: scripts/build_release dir: release ``` Thoughts?</DESCRIPTION>
