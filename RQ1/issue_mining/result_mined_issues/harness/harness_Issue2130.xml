  <TITLE>API scopes for personal tokens</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>moved from https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/1812#issuecomment-253182687 &gt; I don't mind having a real github user and then using drone to generate JWTs with different scopes. Would that be possible? yes, I think this would be a good compromise. you can find the token code here: https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/master/shared/token/token.go we could do something like this: ``` diff type Token struct { Kind string Text string + Scope []string // []string { &quot;repo:read&quot;, &quot;repo:write&quot;, &quot;repo:admin&quot; } ??? + Repos []string // []string { &quot;drone/drone&quot;, &quot;drone/docs&quot; } } ``` Defining a set of scopes will be a bit of a challenge since I'm not sure how granular we want to get, so perhaps we can split this into phases. The first phase could be to add Repos. If the Repos slice is empty we can assume there are no restrictions. Otherwise if the repos slice is not empty we match the current repo to the contents of the slice. Once we have this working, we can get an RFC together with some fine-grained scopes. We should be able to solicit community input for this to make sure we have all of our bases covered.</DESCRIPTION>
