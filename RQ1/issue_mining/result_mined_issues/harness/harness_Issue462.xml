  <TITLE>GitHub Client setting not saved</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Having cloned yesterday, I have it running from a vagrant up. The first admin user does not correspond to my github id, so I go to admin settings and save my actual github client id, then it says the setting has been saved, but when I return the github client id is still the drone login user id. To avoid this, I set up a new drone user corresponding to my github client id and gov it admin. This time I set the github password &amp; wonder whether that has been saved (because of the former &amp; because of password concealment). When I try to create a new drone repository and link to my github account, I see a 404 from github.com . Perhaps a 404 is not an indication that drone has the wrong password for my github account, perhaps it is instead a result of running from localhost. How do I start to debug this?</DESCRIPTION>
