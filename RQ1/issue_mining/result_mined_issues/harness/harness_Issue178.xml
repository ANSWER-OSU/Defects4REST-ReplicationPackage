  <TITLE>Prevent accepting invite if already a team member</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi there, I somehow missed the point on how the User/Team feature worked on the OS version of Drone while deploying it at my company. Briefly, I was expecting that the initial admin account would be able to configure teams, and associate repositories to teams, (similar to what GitHub does). Here are the steps to reproduce the bug: 1. Invite user 2. User signs up though link 3. Delete user account 4. Create team 5. Invite user (same email used in step 1) 6. Following the link the user doesn't se the sign up form, only the login screen. Same thing occurred when using an incognito window in step 6.</DESCRIPTION>
