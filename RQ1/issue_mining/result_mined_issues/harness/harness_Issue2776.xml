  <TITLE>Gitlab 'merged' webhook is ignored</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Assessing the new `action` added in this issue [issue](https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/2685) condition, it seems like `merged` webhooks (hooks firing from gitlab when the repository is merged ) are ignored in drone. That means: - The repository is properly integrated with drone - Hooks are fired and a 200 response is received from drone. - Drone logs show no recollection of handling the `merged` hook (as opposed to `opened` hooks, which are properly evaluated) - Using debug logging, I get this message: ``` {&quot;fields.time&quot;:&quot;2019-08-05T14:37:51Z&quot;,&quot;latency&quot;:625401,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;debug&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;POST&quot;,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;remote&quot;:&quot;172.18.0.1:37804&quot;,&quot;request&quot;:&quot;/hook&quot;,&quot;request-id&quot;:&quot;1P0fKgKxws4QTAmMxVIWV23bHJY&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2019-08-05T14:37:51Z&quot;} ``` I have specific interest to act on this merged event, rather then use the push event fired on the target branch. Any help will be much advised.</DESCRIPTION>
