  <TITLE>`drone version` doesn't return anything.</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Fairly self explanatory, the command `drone version` doesn't actually return anything yet it is a documented option in the help. I've tried this on Ubuntu 13.04 with the 'official' debian package install. Also on Amazon Linux with a drone built from source: ``` [user@myhost bin]$ ./drone -h Drone is a tool for building and testing code in Docker containers. Usage: drone command [arguments] The commands are: build build and test the repository version print the version number vet validate the yaml configuration file -v runs drone with verbose output -h display this help and exit --parallel runs drone build tasks in parallel --timeout=300ms timeout build after 300 milliseconds --privileged runs drone build in a privileged container Examples: drone build builds the source in the pwd drone build /path/to/repo builds the source repository Use &quot;drone help [command]&quot; for more information about a command. [user@myhost bin]$ ./drone version [user@myhost bin]$ ```</DESCRIPTION>
