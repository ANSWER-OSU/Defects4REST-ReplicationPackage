  <TITLE>Multiple CVE and End of life technology</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>There are multiple vulnerabilities within drone images (drone, drone-runniner-kube, drone-vault-extension) as mentioned below. Is there any plan to address this in future release? &lt;html xmlns:v=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml&quot; xmlns:o=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; xmlns:x=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:excel&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta name=ProgId content=Excel.Sheet&gt; &lt;meta name=Generator content=&quot;Microsoft Excel 15&quot;&gt; &lt;link id=Main-File rel=Main-File href=&quot;file:///C:/Users/saj00003/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip.htm&quot;&gt; &lt;link rel=File-List href=&quot;file:///C:/Users/saj00003/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_filelist.xml&quot;&gt; &lt;style&gt; &lt;!--table {mso-displayed-decimal-separator:&quot;\.&quot;; mso-displayed-thousand-separator:&quot;\,&quot;;} @page {margin:.75in .7in .75in .7in; mso-header-margin:.3in; mso-footer-margin:.3in;} tr {mso-height-source:auto;} col {mso-width-source:auto;} br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} td {padding-top:1px; padding-right:1px; padding-left:1px; mso-ignore:padding; color:black; font-size:11.0pt; font-weight:400; font-style:normal; text-decoration:none; font-family:Calibri, sans-serif; mso-font-charset:0; mso-number-format:General; text-align:general; vertical-align:bottom; border:none; mso-background-source:auto; mso-pattern:auto; mso-protection:locked visible; white-space:nowrap; mso-rotate:0;} .xl65 {border:.5pt solid windowtext;} .xl66 {font-weight:700; border:.5pt solid windowtext;} --&gt; &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body link=&quot;#0563C1&quot; vlink=&quot;#954F72&quot;&gt; CVE Name | Asset Name | Vulnerability Description | Remediation | Current Version | Recommended Version | DetailedName -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- CVE-2022-28391 | docker.io/drone/drone-runner-kube | The package `busybox` version `1.32.1-r7` was detected in `APK package manager` on a container image running `Alpine 3.13.7` is vulnerable to `CVE-2022-28391`, which exists in versions `&lt; 1.32.1-r8`.
