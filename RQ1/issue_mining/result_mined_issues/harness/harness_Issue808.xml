  <TITLE>Allow for optional Gravatar username overrides</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>As someone using Drone in a CI environment to test my builds in, I would like to be clearly identified using my own Gravatar which does not use the email address I commit with. In my example, I commit with a work email address but my Gravatar belongs to a personal email address. I shouldn't have to create a WordPress.com/Gravatar account for my work email address.</DESCRIPTION>
