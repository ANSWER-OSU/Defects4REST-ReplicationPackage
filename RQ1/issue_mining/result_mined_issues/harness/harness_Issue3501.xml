  <TITLE>Drone use PAT owner account for git commit</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi @bradrydzewski, I followed your documentation to set up a machine user on Github https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/docker/syntax/cloning/auth/ If I understood it correctly it should clone the repository and allow also for `git commit` and `git push` using the same bot account within the pipelines. So I set up both variables, cloning is probably done through PAT (I can see the activity on this token) but pushing (in my case I want to push a commit and create a tag) is still done by other account - **the one that did the commit before**. Any way to force git user on pipeline runtime? I can't use plugin here - I need to do this directly from the CLI.</DESCRIPTION>
