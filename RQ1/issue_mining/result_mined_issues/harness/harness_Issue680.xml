  <TITLE>.drone.yml confusion</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Is `.drone.yml` only a Drone open-source thing? I'm trying to use it on drone.io, and it's not seeming to be picked up at all. Is there some way to enable it? If so, can I also use a custom docker image on the hosted drone.io version? Is there an article somewhere explaining what the differences are between the hosted and open-source versions, which features are only in one or the other, and if there are planned timelines for synchronizing the two? Thanks.</DESCRIPTION>
