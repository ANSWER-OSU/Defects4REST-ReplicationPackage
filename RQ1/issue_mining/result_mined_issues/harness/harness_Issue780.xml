  <TITLE>Checkout branches other than master?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>How does one go about checking out branches other than master? I see the .drone.yml in this directory has a `git` field in the yaml, but I haven't found the documentation for it. Trying out ``` yaml git: branch: source ``` doesn't seem to do the trick.</DESCRIPTION>
