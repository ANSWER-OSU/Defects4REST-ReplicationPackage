  <TITLE>[Feature Request] Be able to set a starting build number</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>It would be great to be able to set the starting build number. Use case: When you migrate from another build system or even upgrade drone sometimes you want to set the build number to the last of the other system. Seems like in the settings or enable location we could add a starting build number. @bradrydzewski If you have any ideas around what's the best way to handle this, I'm down to take a stab at it.</DESCRIPTION>
