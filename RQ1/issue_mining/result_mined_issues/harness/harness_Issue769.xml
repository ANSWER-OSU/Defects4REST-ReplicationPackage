  <TITLE>Build in PHP server not accessable when starting it with the drone script</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I'm trying to start the build in PHP server to run my acceptance tests. My reason is that it's a lot easier than to setup a nginx or apache. The problem I'm having is that I can't seem to access it. When drone sets it up in docker. It seems that I need to tell drone to open the `8888` port or something. When I do `netstat` I also can see that it's listening to any commands. ``` netstat -tulpn Active Internet connections (only servers) Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address State PID/Program name tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:3306 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 75/socat ``` So I check the processes it is running. ``` ubuntu 191 0.0 0.0 47004 2272 ? R 18:52 0:00 php -S localhost:8888 -t public ``` Also when I start the container itself and ssh into it with the following command: ``` docker run -i -t bradrydzewski/php:5.5 /bin/bash ``` And run the PHP build-in server everything seems to work correctly. I think it has to so with the way drone runs the commands in the `.drone.yml` that the build-in webserver does not work. The issue I'm having is that I just can't get it to work correctly so I'm hoping there is a way to solve this issue. My script if the following, ``` image: bradrydzewski/php:5.5 script: - php -S localhost:8888 -t public &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp; services: - mysql:5.5 ```</DESCRIPTION>
