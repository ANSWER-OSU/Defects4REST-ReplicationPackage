  <TITLE>Everything in the UI should be a link</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Navigating the web UI is currently a little unwieldy. It would be very helpful if the various headers on each page, for example the name of the team when you view a team's repository, were clickable links. These should both be clickable: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1414305/3437132/e24351e8-00aa-11e4-8369-dfe3612cfb24.png) And the branch name here should be clickable and take me to the branch's tests page: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1414305/3437139/fcf26a9c-00aa-11e4-8dbc-f5473c5d322b.png)</DESCRIPTION>
