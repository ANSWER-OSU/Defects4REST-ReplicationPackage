  <TITLE>Can't see other members Builds. but it can by anonymous user.</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Can't see other members Builds. but it can by anonymous user. I'm creating a server. it runs drone.io. (e.g. http://192.168.100.100/ and I'm creating a Builds. It can seen from anywhere. (e.g. http://192.168.100.100/github.com/vvakame/FooBar by the way. new member joined to my server. his name are &quot;mhidaka&quot;. but he can't see http://192.168.100.100/github.com/vvakame/FooBar If he was logout, he can see it. My expected behavior is mhidaka can see http://192.168.100.100/github.com/vvakame/FooBar and i can see his builds. Is anonymous user in a special positions? I'm do not want to limit anyone's view.
