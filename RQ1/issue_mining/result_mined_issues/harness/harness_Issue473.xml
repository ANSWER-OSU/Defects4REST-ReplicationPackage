  <TITLE>Base-url for gitlab</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>GitLab is often located under example `admin.example.com/git/`, and with a setting called `Base URL for GitLab` is really confusing since it looks like it supports having /git/. I changed https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/master/pkg/handler/gitlab.go#L26 and that solved my problem, tho, not a good solution. I'm sorry, no pull-request. I don't know Go</DESCRIPTION>
