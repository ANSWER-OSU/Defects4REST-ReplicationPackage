  <TITLE>Unable to fetch .drone.yml file, from gitlab</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, I am using drone.io + (custom) gitlab integration for some time, but it suddenly stopped to work for new repos I created. When the gitlab call drone hook to start build, the following is written to drone.log: {{{ Unable to fetch .drone.yml file. *Gitlab.buildAndExecRequestRaw failed: &lt;404&gt; }}} Ok, it can be an auth/authz issue. However builds (ci runs) works for existing repo, already configured in drone. I have tried to use new ClientID for gitlab, netrc + add drone user to group, delete repo + reactivate on drone site - same behavior. Still not work only for new repos. Also I do not see any issues on Gitlab side, so it seems to me that drone.io fetch for .drone.yml fails silently which cause interruption during the build. Can you give me any guidance how to debug deeply whats going on, what auth/authz are being used. Thanks in advance.</DESCRIPTION>
