  <TITLE>Improve linking to resources in the remote repository</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>deep links in the user interface are unreliable and do not always link to the desired resource in the source control management system. In many cases they are github specific. the solution to this issue will be to handle the redirects server-side and generate the redirect links on the fly. We have updated the `go-scm` library to include some helper functions to generate deep links for the different providers.</DESCRIPTION>
