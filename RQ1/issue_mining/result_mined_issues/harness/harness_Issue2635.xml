  <TITLE>Running Drone agent on Windows Server 2016</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, Support for Drone Agent on Windows was added in #1330 , however, it is based on an 1803/1809 image. Windows Server 2016 cannot run a Windows docker container that is based on a newer OS image. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/version-compatibility There was a Windows binary release in https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/1330#issuecomment-251129732 but it seems to no longer be updated. Is it possible to publish updated Windows binaries, or (preferably) Docker tags based on Server 2016 as well as the current 1803/1809 tags? So that Drone Agent can run on a Server 2016 PC? Thanks</DESCRIPTION>
