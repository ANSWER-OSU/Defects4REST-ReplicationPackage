  <TITLE>Security issue where user sessions are conflated</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, We're running an evaluation Drone based on `master` (as of 0a6227930). During our testing with multiple (~5) users, we noticed an issue whereby one user, having refreshed the page, was suddenly logged in as another user (that had just registered). This was using the GitHub Enterprise remote plugin. I've had a look through the codebase and can't find what might have caused it, but it feels like a race condition. I'm going to add some debug logging to our local repo so that we have more information should the issue happen again. Has anyone noticed this issue before or have a hunch about what may be causing it? Thanks, Matt</DESCRIPTION>
