  <TITLE>Shared Deployment Key</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, I have put this [uservoice](http://drone.uservoice.com/forums/176976-feedback-for-drone-io/suggestions/5812947-shared-deployment-key), though I don't think it is receiving any love, so I post here as well. Feel free to close it down if it is not the appropriate place. Currently, each build has its own deployment key. It doesn't really scale well with my requirement. My project setup is like this: - There is 1 parent project that is the dependencies for all other projects. - There are lots of children projects that will clone that parent project during the build process. These children projects are the ones imported to drone. I can work around it by adding the key of the children projects one-by-one to the deployment key of the parent project. This doesn't scale well since I have hundreds of child projects. Can I have some kind of a shared key that the child projects share so I only need to add that one shared key to the deployment keys of the parent project?</DESCRIPTION>
