  <TITLE>Become Official Slack Service</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>It would be great to become an official Slack plugin: ![slack_integration_message](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/817538/5914025/b467b906-a5a2-11e4-8249-60e42549a0a3.png) I've gotten a lot of feedback about this as well. I was hoping for some help from our Slack enthusiasts out there. If anyone is interested let me know. I'll be contacting the Slack team to see what we need to do to make things official.</DESCRIPTION>
