  <TITLE>GitHub 'closed' webhook is ignored</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I'm testing the functionality introduced in https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/2685, but it seems like the `closed` action is ignored. This can be also seen in the database, where there are just `create`, `sync`, `opened`, `synchronized` in the `build_action` column of the `builds` database. I would have expected all of the actions to be recorded based on: https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/bcdd4bf0245c82c060407b3b24b9b87301d15ac1/service/hook/parser/parse.go#L249 Upd: just noticed that everything apart of open and sync is ignored: https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/bcdd4bf0245c82c060407b3b24b9b87301d15ac1/service/hook/parser/parse.go#L234-L237 Would it be enough to simply change that to to include close, while adding the corresponding action? https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/e855881324dcdf912e70f94d6c7abc1d985cdbd3/core/hook.go#L22-L28 However, I do not understand where the `synchronized` action comes from which can be seen in the database.</DESCRIPTION>
