  <TITLE>WP_JSON_Posts-&gt;prepare_author() needs check that $user exists</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>In the prepare_author method there is a conditional early return if the $author parameter wasn't passed, we should add an additional condition to verify the $user object was returned. This is a minor bug in the logic, but it can happen if a user account was removed but the deleted user's posts weren't re-assigned. Pull request with minor fix forthcoming.</DESCRIPTION>
