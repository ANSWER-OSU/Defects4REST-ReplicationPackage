  <TITLE>Usage of `/pages` in the `WP_JSON_Pages` class</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>In line with the excellent advice from the [doc on Extending the API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/blob/master/docs/guides/extending.md#designing-your-entities): &gt; You should also consider how other plugins might extend your data, and design for this. I think it would be a good move to replace hardcoded references to the `/pages` base route in `WP_JSON_Pages` with `$this-&gt;base`. Doing so would allow plugins to extend the `WP_JSON_Pages` class for custom post types that are very similar to the `page` post type and would benefit from methods like `getPostByPath()` etc. methods.</DESCRIPTION>
