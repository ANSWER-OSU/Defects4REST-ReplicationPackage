  <TITLE>comments collection ordering: Why is default &quot;asc&quot;?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>for `/posts` collections, the most recent articles are the first ones returned: you step back through pages to step back through time. for `/comments`, the oldest comments are shown first, as the default ordering for the comments collection is `asc`. This feels inconsistent, and I wanted to raise the question to see whether all collections should follow the same default ordering by date.</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Alter default comment sort order to be &quot;desc&quot; This follows discussion in #2588 and [in slack][slack-log] around standardizing the sort order of the comments endpoint to bring it in line with both the other endpoints in the API, and with `WP_Comment_Query`, by switching back to &quot;desc&quot; as the default sort order. Note that is a breaking change if API consumers are relying on comment order to be ascending by default.
