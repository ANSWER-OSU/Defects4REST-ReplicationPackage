  <TITLE>prepare_taxonomy() returns empty array for key 'types'</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>At first glance it seemed like this would be an array of post types supported by the taxonomy. @rmccue is this legacy code or a placeholder for something? I know this could possibly conflict with the new structure proposed here: http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/28/potential-roadmap-for-taxonomy-meta-and-post-relationships/</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>Add new methods for base /taxonomies routes &amp; update tests Because the new /taxonomies route have no $type parameter, and $type cannot be removed without breaking back-compat, we need to add a new set of route methods for the new, &quot;correct&quot; /taxonomies routes. To minimize confusion, the old route method names were left as is, and new methods added for each method which had previously taken a $type. All the old methods are marked @deprecated and have a @see reference to their successors. New methods: - `get_taxonomy` now wraps the new `get_taxonomy_object` - `prepare_taxonomy` now wraps the new `prepare_taxonomy_object` - `get_terms` now wraps the new `get_taxonomy_terms` - `get_term` now wraps the new `get_taxonomy_terms` - `prepare_term` now wraps the new `prepare_taxonomy_term` The existing unit tests were changed to point to these new route methods.</MESSAGE>

      <MESSAGE>Embed associated post type records in Taxonomy objects This is the first pass at embedding a list of associated post types in taxonomy records, as described in #197. Types are NOT embedded if they would be added to a taxonomy record that is itself embedded. @rmccue has proposed changing how the $_in_taxonomy behavior works to use a &quot;$context&quot; variable, as in other methods; this commit should be considered a work-in-progress until he has signed off on it.</MESSAGE>
