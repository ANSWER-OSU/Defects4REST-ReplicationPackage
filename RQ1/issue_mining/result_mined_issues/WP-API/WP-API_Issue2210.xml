  <TITLE>filter[ignore_sticky_posts]=false doesn't work with GET /wp/v2/posts</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Right now there's is no way to use the `sticky` parameter at all. This feels like a pretty big issue, as this is core functionality in WP. See threads on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34970734/wp-api-filter-by-post-schema) and [Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp-api-filter-by-sticky) for examples of how the community seems to want this feature. Given that `sticky` is already part of the schema, it would make sense if we could just sort by that as a query. However, reading #924 and #1801 and #1623, there seems to be discussions around `ignore_sticky_posts`, `respect_sticky_posts` or `include_sticky_posts` **filter** params, but none of these seem to have made it into recent betas. What's the status on this? And any chance we can get it soon? Thanks!</DESCRIPTION>
