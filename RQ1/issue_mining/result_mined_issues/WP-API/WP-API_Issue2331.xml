  <TITLE>Is the link to WP-API 1.2.5 intentional? (among other links)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The readme points to https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/ within: &quot;The latest stable version is available from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/).&quot; Which is the old version 1.2.5; which is really nothing like this version. Likewise, the plugin page within WP admin points to http://wp-api.org/ for the &quot;WP REST API Team&quot; and &quot;view details&quot; points to an [information page](https://wirehub.dfmdev.com/wp-admin/plugin-install.php?tab=plugin-information&amp;plugin=wp-api&amp;TB_iframe=true&amp;width=600&amp;height=550) which is regarding a [WP API version 1.0.3](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-api/), which is entirely different! Is that all intentional since 2.0 is still beta?</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>#2331 Fix links in plugin docs This is a partial fix to #2331. This fixes the link for the WP REST API TEAM to point to v2 and fixes a link in the readme portion of the plugin to point to the v2 plugin instead of v1. Because there is a plugin named wp-api in the WordPress.org plugin repository it is matching the View Details link to that plugin which has zero relevance to WP REST API v2.</MESSAGE>
