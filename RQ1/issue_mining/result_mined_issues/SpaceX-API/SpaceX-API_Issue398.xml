  <TITLE>Launchpad/Landpad status field</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Model returned from the Launchpads endpoint contains `Status` field which is defined as enum (https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/v4/launchpads/schema.md): ``` &quot;status&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;String&quot;, &quot;enum&quot;: [ &quot;active&quot;, &quot;inactive&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;, &quot;retired&quot;, &quot;lost&quot;, &quot;under construction&quot; ], &quot;required&quot;: true }, ``` The model returned from the Landpads endpoint has also a similar one, but in the schema, it's defined just as a plain string (https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/v4/landpads/schema.md): ``` &quot;status&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;String&quot;, &quot;default&quot;: null }, ``` Shouldn't be the second one exactly the same as the first one? From what I saw comparing data from both endpoints, this field has exactly the same meaning and the same values.</DESCRIPTION>
