  <TITLE>Fairing endpoint</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>SpaceX has been trying not only to recover fairings, but has also reflown some of them. Usually if a fairing is reused it is announced on Twitter after the static fire is succesfully executed or some minutes prior the liftoff during the webcast. I thought that an endpoint like this should be like this: |Field|Explanation| |---|---| |id|Assign an unique ID to each half of the fairing, because if two fairing halves fly together, they may fly again on different launches; |launches|List all launches in which the specific fairing has partecipated |ships|List all ships who have caught or tried to caught it |net_landing_attempts|Number of all attempts to landing on the net (both of Ms.Tree/Ms.Chief, since it's quite difficult to say which reflown halves was caught by a specific ship) |net_landing_success|Number of successfully landing on the net (both of Ms.Tree/Ms.Chief) |water_landing_attempts|Sometimes one or both ships are unavailable but fairing are still tried to be recovered using GO Searcher. Not all water landings result in succesfull recovery, because fairing can break up. |water_landing_success|Number of times fairing has been succesfully recovered from water (only if there are no fairing catchers ships available) |status|List all the results from the various launches, using a sort of enum: caught, recovered from water by fairing catcher, no attempt but recovered, destroyed, no attempt I'm struggling how to easily represent the status of attempts: the one I wrote above are just the first thing that came up in my mind. The fairing endpoint that is active now, would be replaced by this one. Obiouvsly suggestions are welcomed and also @jakewmeyer has the last word, since he is the owner and knows how to implement this.</DESCRIPTION>
