  <TITLE>Difference between Upcoming and All Launches?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Really love this API and I will keep it short to steal as little time as possible. I want to fetch both the past+upcoming launches, which promptly made me choose the v4.../launches/ endpoint but now, after testing the /upcoming endpoint, I notice a discrepancy. The information provided after the past launches in the /launches endpoint don't match with the information listed under the /upcoming endpoint. May someone be kind enough to clear up the confusion? ### (1st Window: /past, 2nd Window: /upcoming, 3rd Window: /launches) ![Screenshot_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45468984/126913588-0a475f6e-ad43-4519-9ded-553e8de25452.png)</DESCRIPTION>
