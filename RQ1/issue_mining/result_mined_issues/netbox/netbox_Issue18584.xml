  <TITLE>Add rack types column to manufacturers table</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### NetBox version v4.2.2 ### Feature type Data model extension ### Proposed functionality Manufacturers screen lists Device Types and Module Types but does not display Rack Types. It would be very helpful to have an option to include Rack Types from the “Configure Table” feature in the Manufacturers view. This enhancement would make it easier to manage and reference all equipment types from one place, improving overall workflow and consistency. ### Use case Currently, users can assign manufacturers when creating rack types; however, there isn’t a straightforward way to view or filter these rack types by manufacturer within the interface. It would be very helpful if NetBox provided a column by RackType from the manufacturer’s page. This improvement would: Enhance Usability – Quickly locate all rack types associated with a specific manufacturer. Streamline Workflows – Reduce the time spent searching for or cross-referencing rack types. Thank you for considering this request ### Database changes No DB Change Require. Presentation request only ### External dependencies No dependencies. Presentation request only</DESCRIPTION>
