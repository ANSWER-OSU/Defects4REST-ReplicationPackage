  <TITLE>Add contact filters to services</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### NetBox version v4.2.1 ### Feature type New functionality ### Proposed functionality [Release v4.0.5](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/pull/16429) added contact assignment for services as requested in [issue 14810](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/14810), but in contrast to other entities (e.g. devices, virtual machines), the filter view for services does not include any options to filter by an assigned contact. The filter view (or the metadata from which the view is generated) could be modified to include contact filters for improved consistence. ### Use case When managing a high number of services in NetBox, any available filter might help to narrow down a specific search or to create a specific list for export. Filtering services by contact assignments would benefit users in the same way as filtering devices or virtual machines by contact assignments benefits them right now. ### Database changes This proposal does not include any new models or any new fields. If the default filters in NetBox are generated by some kind of metadata in the database (like for custom fields), this specific option might need to be changed. Otherwise the change will just affect the user interface. ### External dependencies _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
