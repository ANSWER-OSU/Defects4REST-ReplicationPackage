  <TITLE>Value after * must be an iterable, not NoneType</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Deployment Type Self-hosted ### NetBox Version v4.3.0-beta2 ### Python Version 3.12 ### Steps to Reproduce 1. Upgrade from a fully functional NetBox v4.2.7 to v4.3.0-beta2 2. After clicking on certain menu items, I encounter the following error page (see Observed behavior section) The menu items that trigger the error in my case include: Organization &gt; Regions Organization &gt; Site Groups Organization &gt; Locations Organization &gt; Tenants Organization &gt; Tenant Groups Organization &gt; Contact Roles Devices &gt; Modules Devices &gt; Platforms and more of the others. I'm eager to help troubleshoot this issue and provide any additional information needed, but I would appreciate some guidance on what specific information or logs I can provide to help narrow it down. ### Expected Behavior Menu items and their submenus should open and display content without errors. ### Observed Behavior I get the following error page: ``` Server Error There was a problem with your request. Please contact an administrator. The complete exception is provided below: &lt;class 'TypeError'&gt; Value after * must be an iterable, not NoneType Python version: 3.12.3 NetBox version: 4.3.0-beta2 Plugins: None installed If further assistance is required, please post to the [NetBox discussion forum](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/discussions) on GitHub. ``` ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/908635e4-5c1a-4a7b-beae-20287c509304)</DESCRIPTION>
