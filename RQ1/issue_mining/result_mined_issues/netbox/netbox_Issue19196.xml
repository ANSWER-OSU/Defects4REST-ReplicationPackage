  <TITLE>Add Filtering by VLAN Translation Policy to Interface Filter Forms</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### NetBox version v4.2.7 ### Feature type New functionality ### Proposed functionality Add support for filtering interfaces by VLAN Translation Policy in both DCIM and Virtualization filter forms. This would involve adding a new filter field to `InterfaceFilterSet` and `VMInterfaceFilterSet`, allowing users to filter interfaces by their VLAN translation policy. ### Use case Currently, there's no way to filter interfaces by VLAN Translation Policy in the UI, even though the field is available in the data model. Adding this filter would improve usability by helping users quickly identify interfaces with specific translation policies. ### Database changes No changes required. ### External dependencies None.</DESCRIPTION>
