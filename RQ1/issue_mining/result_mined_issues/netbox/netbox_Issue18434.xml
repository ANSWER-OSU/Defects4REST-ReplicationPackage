  <TITLE>Add SPB in L2VPN</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### NetBox version v4.2.2 ### Feature type Data model extension ### Proposed functionality This feature request proposes adding support for **Shortest Path Bridging (SPB)** as an option in NetBox's `L2VPNTypeChoices`. These addition aim to enhance NetBox’s ability to model and document SPB networks effectively. ### Specific Changes: 1. **L2VPNTypeChoices**: - Add `TYPE_SPB` with a user-facing label of &quot;SPB.&quot; - Update the `CHOICES` tuple to include a new category or entry for SPB. 2. **Workflows and Data Models**: - This change would expand the selection of supported protocols in `L2VPNTypeChoices`. - They would not alter existing workflows but offer more options for documenting and managing network infrastructures. 4. **User Interface**: - These new options would be visible in any form or interface where the `L2VPNTypeChoices` is used. ![L2VPNType Choices](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2992ff24-86a7-43c8-a14c-0aab3eeacfd9) **Note:** I am ready to submit a pull request with the proposed modifications. My commit is already available here: [https://github.com/Mathias-gt/netbox/commit/ecc679ad1e86cc5466352528a0c5f6054e13f2a5](https://github.com/Mathias-gt/netbox/commit/ecc679ad1e86cc5466352528a0c5f6054e13f2a5). --- ### Use case Adding support for SPB addresses the need for modern networks to document and manage increasingly diverse protocols. This protocol is widely deployed in enterprise networks for its scalability, flexibility, and simplicity. ### Benefits: - **SPB**: Enables users to document deployments of Shortest Path Bridging, used for simplifying and scaling Layer 2 networks. Supporting this L2VPN type ensures that NetBox can serve as a comprehensive source of truth for organizations using this protocol. --- ### Database changes No changes to the database schema are required. The proposed functionality involves extending the existing `L2VPNTypeChoices`. These changes will only add new constants and options to existing enumerations, leveraging the current model structure. ### External dependencies No new external dependencies are introduced by this feature. The proposed changes only extend existing functionality within NetBox's existing framework.</DESCRIPTION>
