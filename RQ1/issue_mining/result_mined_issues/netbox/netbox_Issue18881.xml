  <TITLE>Site Groups are missing VLAN and VM related objects</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Deployment Type Self-hosted ### NetBox Version v.4.2.4 ### Python Version 3.10 ### Steps to Reproduce 1. Create a Site Group &quot;Example Site Group&quot; 2. Create a VLAN group &quot;Example VLAN Group&quot; with scope &quot;DCIM &gt; Site Group&quot; 3. Assign the VLAN group to the &quot;Example Site Group&quot; 4. Create the VLAN group 5. Go to Site Groups 6. See that there is no reference to any VLANs or VLAN groups even though it's literally the only parent object that has been selected for the created VLAN group ### Expected Behavior Site groups should reference the same related objects as Sites, and not just a subset of them. That way it would be not only useful but also possible to see all: - VLANs - VLAN Groups - Virtual Machines - ASNs - Clusters - Devices that are present within a Site Group. ### Observed Behavior Here's a screenshot of a `Site's` related objects, that is part of a Site Group: ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d562b32-da67-415f-bd4a-044df1a9758b) Note the highlighted related objects. Now, here's a screenshot of a `Site Group's` (where the above Site is a member of) related objects: ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a991f19-052d-477f-abec-05bf990b4c00) Notice the following objects mising: - VLANs - VLAN Groups - Virtual Machines - ASNs - Clusters - Devices</DESCRIPTION>
