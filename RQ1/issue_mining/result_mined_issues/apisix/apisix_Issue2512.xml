  <TITLE>doc: misleading guide for creating consumer via POST method in Admin API</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Issue description As @membphis mentioned in https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/2485#issuecomment-716079025 : ``` for POST method, it means will create new objects always. for consumer, one name only can create one consumer. so we do not allow to use POST method to create consumer object. ``` While the Admin API doc still shows its support for `POST` method to create consumer, which is incorrect. So we should remove relevant chapter from Admin API, as well as add some remarks on the reason.</DESCRIPTION>
