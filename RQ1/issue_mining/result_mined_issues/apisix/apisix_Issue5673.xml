  <TITLE>docs: refactor Installation Guide</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Improved or typo fixed. Hi, in our `How to build` docs[1], we may need to improve or refactor it due to the following issues: 1. Step 1 says we need to install dependencies first, when we open that document, it links to another page under the Other category. If this step is necessary, maybe we could combine them into one document. 2. When we run commands according to the Install Dependencies document, ETCD will be installed and executed by &quot;nohup etcd &amp;&quot;, this way will not persist ETCD's data; 3. Also, after we install the dependencies, the OpenResty will be installed, too. And if we try to install by using RPM directly, an error will occur and it says we need to uninstall OpenResty, this is a little wired. This step is removed by https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/5659 yesterday. [1] https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/how-to-build ### Solution After the meeting, most of the attendees agree to refactor the Install Documentation :) Maybe we could have a structure first on the new docs?</DESCRIPTION>
