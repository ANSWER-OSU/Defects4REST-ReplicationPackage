  <TITLE>Add Arabic Translation</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION># Improve Docs ## Please describe which part of docs should be improved or typo fixed Did you know that the Arab world considered one of the rising stars that will shape the 4th industrial revolution? ![Arab Startups](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81928799/114578559-a8b5c400-9c85-11eb-8d9f-25dff730a617.JPG) and with 300 million people speaking Arabic, it's definitely a market that you wanna get involve with! ## Describe the solution you'd like I've been working with my friend @jbampton here and with his team on Git to try to adapt translation solution to multiple projects. Our suggestion is to offer Arabic to be added to the list of languages Apache Apisix offers. I'll start with the **README.md** I have plenty of experience doing translations in either direction (Arabic-English) Also, I have a quick turnaround as I have a lot of available time to do this translation in a correct and professional manner. and I'm always willing to offer to extend this issue into other docs and pages that are already translated into multiple languages like Spanish for instance. This would be a great opportunity to perform organic marketing where it reaches a whole new market &quot;we're talking about middle east and north Africa&quot;. This would add value and a unique new feature to the project!</DESCRIPTION>
