  <TITLE>feat: As a user, I want to hide credentials for jwt-auth plugin, so that we wouldn't get jwt token at upstream</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Description Hello, I found that now those auth plugins had support &quot;hide_credentials&quot; | plugin | field | url | | ---- | ---- | ---- | | key-auth | hide_credentials | https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/next/plugins/key-auth/ | | basic-auth | hide-credentials | https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/next/plugins/basic-auth/ | | hmac-auth | keep_headers | https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/next/plugins/hmac-auth/ | But `jwt-auth` plugin doesn't support hiding credentials so we will get the credentials at upstream. It may cause some security problems. I think we should support it.</DESCRIPTION>
