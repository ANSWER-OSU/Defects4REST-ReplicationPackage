  <TITLE>Order roles alphabetically on the admin</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>&lt;!-- Please also see the docs on how we manage issues: https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/latest/docs/guides/contributing/managing-issues/. --&gt; ### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. /Admin/Roles/Index will show a seemingly random order of roles: ![{FBC208C3-14EE-469C-8C5A-D7E8DC591800}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a4630e0-55b0-4caf-b1e8-fa0861fa7dc5) This makes it harder to find the role you want to manage. ### Describe the solution you'd like Order the roles alphabetically. ### Describe alternatives you've considered Perhaps order by last modified (latest on top), but with the usual amount of roles, really the most straightforward would be just alphabetic order. We don't need custom ordering.</DESCRIPTION>
