  <TITLE>Honor secured items inside a BagPart</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. I want some users to be able to add content-items to a specific bag while others to only be able to view only existing items. ### Describe the solution you'd like Currently, any content item contained in a `BagPart` is always editable regardless if the contained item is securable or not. In most cases this is fine. However, I think that this function should also be extended to honor the security rules when the contained item is securable. This means, a user with `EditContent` permission can add/edit items to the `BagPart` whereas user with `ViewContent` permission only should see the content item as read only version &quot;like preview&quot; but should not be able to make any change to it. ### Describe alternatives you've considered override the existing `BagPartDisplayDriver`, `ContentCard.Frame.cshtml` and `BagPart.Edit.cshtml` to do the above.</DESCRIPTION>
