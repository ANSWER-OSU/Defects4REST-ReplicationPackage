  <TITLE>OpenId Deployment and Recipes have some issues</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>There are a number of issues with the OpenId Recipe and Deployment Steps - The Deployment Step for the Server Settings produces **completely incorrect** JSON to match what the Recipe Step is expecting (the settings directly, when the step expects a Model) - Some of the Steps use Models, some use `CreateViewModels` - Most of the Steps are storing their data directly in the step property, where they should be keyed. (Minor issue) - The Application Step can only be run once, as it does not check to see if the application already exists, so throws an exception the second time.</DESCRIPTION>
