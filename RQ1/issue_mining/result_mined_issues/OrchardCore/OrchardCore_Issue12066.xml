  <TITLE>Add ContainedStereotypes property to ContentPickerFieldSettings to allow a user to include content-types by steryotype</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. When attaching `ContentPickerField` to a content part, the user must explicitly set [DisplayedContentTypes](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/blob/main/src/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.ContentFields/Settings/ContentPickerFieldSettings.cs#L9) with an array of content-types to be include in the `ContentPickerField`. This is good for most case, however, it would be great to allow for setting the contained content-types using Stereotype. Stereotype would be in addition to not in place of `DisplayedContentTypes`. For example, I want to group all todo items (appointment, meeting) by a stereotype type called `ToDoTask`. All of these content types share similar functionally which is a todo task. Now I want to use `ContentPickerField` in a different content type to allow the user to select a todo-task of any kind. In this case, I have to explicitly specific each content types that in the `DisplayedContentTypes`. But if a new content-type was added later &quot;from other feature/module&quot;, the user would have manually to edit the `ContentPickerField` settings every time/every where todo task are used to add the new content-type which it isn't efficient. ### Describe the solution you'd like Add a way to specific a stereotypes in the `ContentPickerFieldSettings` in addition to `DisplayedContentTypes` so the user is able to explicitly able to set displayed-content-types or explicitly set the stereotype. We can achieve this by changing the `ContentPickerFieldSettings` to something like this ``` public class BagPartSettings { public string Hint { get; set; } public bool Required { get; set; } public bool Multiple { get; set; } public bool DisplayAllContentTypes { get; set; } = Array.Empty&lt;string&gt;(); public string[] DisplayedContentTypes { get; set; } = Array.Empty&lt;string&gt;(); public string[] DisplayedStereotypes { get; set; } = Array.Empty&lt;string&gt;(); } ```</DESCRIPTION>
