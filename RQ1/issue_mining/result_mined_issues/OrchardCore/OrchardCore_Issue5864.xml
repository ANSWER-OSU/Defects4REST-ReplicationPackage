  <TITLE>Culture vuejs select is slow</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The vuejs Culture Select is slow to select new cultures. To select an item from the cultures list when localization is enabled takes around 25 seconds for the add method to complete, and the culture to become selectable. I haven't had time for a good look, but I can see from the code we have fallen into a `v-for` and `v-if` trap. https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html#v-for-with-v-if However I suspect it's the add method that is running slowly. Must be a regression as it wasn't running this slowly last time I used it.</DESCRIPTION>
