  <TITLE>Remove hard coded HTML ids from UserFields.Edit.cshtml view</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. I am trying to create a feature that would allow an Admin to bulk import users from excel file. After the user uploaded the excel file, I want to build the Edit fields for every user in my file. This means calling the `UserFields.Edit.cshtml` multiple times in the same output. The only problem that I am facing is that the password generator fails because the same html id are used on the same page which is not good. Here are the hard coded ids `generatePassword`, `passwordConfirmationToggle`, `passwordToggle` and `copyPassword`. ### Describe the solution you'd like We should never hard code fixed ID in views that are used by driver. Instead, we should dynamically generate ID or class name to allow the user to reuse the views if needed like in my case. ### Workaround I override the view in my own theme, but since this view is driver driven, I think it should be robust.</DESCRIPTION>
