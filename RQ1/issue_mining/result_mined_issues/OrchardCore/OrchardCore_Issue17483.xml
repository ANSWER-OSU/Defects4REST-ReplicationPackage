  <TITLE>Add &quot;save and continue&quot; button to admin menu node editor</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is your feature request related to a problem? When editing a admin menu, there is no option to &quot;save and continue&quot; to stay on the edit page. After saving the menu, user is always redirect to list view, which slows user down in case they want to debug or try things out. ### Describe the solution you'd like Add save and continue button to admin menu edit (create?) view. This would also unify the behiviour and design with content item edit view. ### Describe alternatives you've considered Perhaps it would be best to rewrite admin menu display management so it would be the same as the content management. This requires much more effort however.</DESCRIPTION>
