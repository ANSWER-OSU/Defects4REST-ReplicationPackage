  <TITLE>Add support for the ReCaptcha onload callback</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. I use JQuery Unobtrusive Validation to validate my forms. I also use the ReCaptcha feature to protect my forms against robots. I'd like to be able to add validation to the reCAPTCHA form element, which is loaded dynamically and thus can't be added until after the reCAPTCHA is loaded. Fortunately, Google provides an `onload` parameter that you can provide on the ReCaptcha script ([see documentation](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display#explicit_render)). Unfortunately, there isn't a convenient way to specify that parameter and when using the `ReCaptchaTagHelper`. ### Describe the solution you'd like Add an attribute to the `ReCaptchaTagHelper` for specifying the onload callback. ### Describe alternatives you've considered For my site, I replaced the base Orchard Core `ReCaptchaTagHelper` with a custom implementation with the onload attribute.</DESCRIPTION>
