  <TITLE>ShapeViewModel should have an overload that would accept the ShapeType</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. I need to create a shape manually using [ShapeViewModel&lt;&gt;](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/blob/339d74b251b53393dd510f8ad3027aa17d78500d/src/OrchardCore/OrchardCore.DisplayManagement/Views/ShapeViewModelOfT.cs#L5) directly. I had to do that in 2 steps 1. initialize mt shape 2. Set the Type on the Metadata object. ### Describe the solution you'd like I think `ShapeViewModelOfT` should have an overload constructor that would allow the consumer to provider a custom `shapeType`. I think we may want to event set the `Metadata.Type` on the current constructor so the Type is set by default.</DESCRIPTION>
