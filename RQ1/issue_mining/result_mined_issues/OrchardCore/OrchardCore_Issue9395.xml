  <TITLE>Admin dashboard: does not work on tenant?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Describe the bug I can create and unpublish dashboard widgets, but can not modify or delete. It has happened to me on 2 projects and only difference between others is that they run more tenants (with Tenants feature enabled). When there is only default tenant, everything is ok. What happens is that if I click on Edit button: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52829889/117619661-d5b7a280-b16f-11eb-9d66-22cc48dca783.png) (leads here: /Admin/dashboard/manage?returnUrl=%2FAdmin%2Fdashboard%2Fmanage) it only refreshes page AND also updates last changed date, but does not even open editor view. Delete does nothing at all, unpublish works. ### Expected behavior A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. Edit should open edit view, delete should delete.</DESCRIPTION>
