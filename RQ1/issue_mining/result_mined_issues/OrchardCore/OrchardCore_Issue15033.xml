  <TITLE>Search Form does not show up when using Azure Search AI</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>There is a bug in the `TheBlogTheme` theme that I have no explanation for as of now. If you enable `Azure Search AI` and `Search` features, the search form does NOT show up. To workaround this issue, you have to enabled either `Lucene` or `Elasticsearch` features for the search bar to show up. When the request is made to `/search` endpoint, the line is reached https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/blob/main/src/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.Search/Controllers/SearchController.cs#L91 which returns the Search.cshtml view https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/blob/main/src/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.Search/Views/Search/Search.cshtml That view would render `Search__List` shape, which then renders `Search__Form` and `Search__Results` shapes. What could be causing this views not to render? Everything works using other themes like TheDefault theme which tells me that there is something about the blog theme that isn't working as it should. ![azure-cognitive-search-4](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/assets/24724371/f934c216-8e5e-4519-8c67-f66f9070c90e) @Skrypt Do you have any idea why this could be happening?</DESCRIPTION>
