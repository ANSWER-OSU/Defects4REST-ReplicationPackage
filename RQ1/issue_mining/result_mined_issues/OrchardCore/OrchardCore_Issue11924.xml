  <TITLE>Add Manage Steps to the button to the deployemnt and add description to the feature</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. When viewing deployment plans on the UI, clicking the title directs the user manage steps page which is great. However, there is no other indication about managing steps. In other words, the user does not know the different between edit or manage steps. ### Describe the solution you'd like I think we should add a button called &quot;Manage Steps&quot; that also direct the user to the manage deployment plans. This way the user can easily understand that there are 2 edit function here (i.e., one for Editing the the steps and the other one for editing the deployment plant itself.) Also the Deployment feature should have some sort of description like `Provides a way to import and export packages`</DESCRIPTION>
