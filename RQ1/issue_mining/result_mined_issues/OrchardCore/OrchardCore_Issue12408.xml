  <TITLE>Sort permission by Descriptions instead on a name in Roles UI</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. Currently, we sort permission by `Name` which it isn't something visible to the users. When the description is different than, permissions won't show up in alphabetical order because we sort by `name` by show `description` ### Describe the solution you'd like To sort them properly, they should be sorted by `Description` property instead since that is what the users see or care about. The following screenshot is an example of how sorting by `Name` does not work well. As you can see the permission &quot;Assign users....&quot; permission is showing up after the &quot;Manage....&quot;. The reason in this case the permissions are not showing up as expected is because the permission &quot;Assign any role&quot; has a name of `AssignRole`. However, `Assign users to ....` has a name of `ManageUsersInRole...`. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24724371/190420765-036fd606-c8c0-4e0e-81e0-105c5c7aa295.png)</DESCRIPTION>
