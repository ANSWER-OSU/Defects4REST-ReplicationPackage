  <TITLE>OrchardCore.Contents API: Admin user is not able to GET a content, an error 401 unauthorized is returned, but if I grant all privileges to the &quot;anonymous&quot; user role, it works</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Describe the bug According to what discussed [here](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/discussions/15372#discussioncomment-8544179) with @hishamco, I'm opening this issue to verify it. The module `OrchardCore.Contents` exposes an `ApiController.cs` with endpoints to _create_, _update_, and _delete_ content items created in the &quot;Admin&quot; backoffice. Using _Postman_, it's possible to call the `ApiController.cs` endpoints after configuring the &quot;OpenID Connect&quot; `OpenID Authorization Server` module. I tested this using the &quot;Try Orchard&quot; website. **The authentication** process **is successful**, and I receive a valid OAuth 2 token. **But, when attempting to use the &quot;Admin&quot; user**, which is supposed to have the highest privileges, **I cannot perform GET, UPDATE, or DELETE operations**, I receive a 401 unauthorized error. **Instead, if I grant all privileges to the &quot;anonymous&quot; user role** to call the API, and remove the OAuth token, **it works**. ### To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior: NOTE: _As mentioned, I'm using a temporary &quot;try.orchardcore&quot; website, which is why I'm sharing the credentials here. They will expire along with the temporary website._ 1. Import the Postman collection attached [Test.postman_collection.zip](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/files/14362999/Test.postman_collection.zip) (it already contains the Client Id and Secret); 2. Get an authorization token via Postman &quot;Authorization&quot; blade (all the fields should be already set) 3. Try to call this endpoint using GET method: https://try.orchardcore.net/jgjn0h2r/api/content/455vmd500wgrj7nqqpysw3px4s 4. You will get error 401 Unauthorized ### Expected behavior The &quot;Admin&quot; user**, which is supposed to have the highest privileges, must be able to retrieve a content from the GET endpoint. ### Screenshots Postman Authorization blade configuration ![image](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/assets/19241483/26058490-0add-404f-8481-b2c4a0f35871)</DESCRIPTION>
