  <TITLE>Recipes do not support comments</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The recipe reader doesn't support comments in Json (it's a mode that isn't turned on). Which is annoying when you have a lot of recipes, and need to make notes in them, as to why you did something. Not sure if the System.Text pr has gone in yet, might change with that, as it's a Newtonsoft config that needs to be set.</DESCRIPTION>
