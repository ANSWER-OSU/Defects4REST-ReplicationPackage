  <TITLE>Tenant Recipe not working</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I have an issue that was reported in #3346 Here is how to reproduce the problem: Generate a theme using the template generator. Copy over the files and folders from TheAgencyTheme into you new custom theme. Modify the recipe file you copied over Try and run the recipe as a tenant It wont work. You will get the layout exception. To fix it you then go to themes and enable a different theme and then go back to themes and enable your custom theme problem fixed. It would be nice if the recipe worked first. There must be something in the recipe file that needs to be changed that is being missed.</DESCRIPTION>
