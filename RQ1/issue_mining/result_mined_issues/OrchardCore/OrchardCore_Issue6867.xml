  <TITLE>GitHub Discussions setup</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>As we've talked about it before, GitHub has a new beta featured called Discussions. I've now enabled this, see https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/discussions/6869 for details. This issue is to track any tasks for setting it up. Possible to-dos if and when we completely embrace Discussions, depending on what we decide, all contingent. ~~- [ ] Close Gitter.~~ - [ ] Change the Forum link on the website. - [ ] Convert issues with the &quot;discussion&quot; and &quot;question&quot; tags to discussions. This can be done in bulk from under [Labels](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/labels). Ex: https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/labels/discussion - [x] ~~Add a very long and opinionated issue template to upset @sebastienros~~ Add an issue template that directs people to discussions for things that are not bug reports or feature requests. This can be nothing more than `&lt;!-- instructions --&gt;`. - [x] Point https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md#other-discussions to Discussions and thus recommend it instead of StackOverflow.</DESCRIPTION>
