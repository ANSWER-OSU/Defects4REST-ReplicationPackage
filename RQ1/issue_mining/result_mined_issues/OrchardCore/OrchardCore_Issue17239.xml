  <TITLE>Remove the checkbox next to each widget</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>When editing widgets on the Layers UI (/Admin/Layers), each widget has a checkbox next to it. These checkboxes currently are useless and don't do anything. We should either remove the check box, or add a bulk action menu for each zone on the upper right hand side to allow us to Publish, Unpublish, or delete all selected widgets. But usually there isn't tons of widgets on that UI, so adding bulk action may not be used much. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4926b119-372e-4402-ad78-4c1d21a01838) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/326f419c-f59a-4462-9745-49e83e921cb3)</DESCRIPTION>
