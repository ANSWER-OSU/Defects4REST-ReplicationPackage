  <TITLE>MSSQL Connection String Fails on Orchard Core Setup - &quot;The provided connection string is invalid or server is unreachable.&quot;</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I am doing the basic setup for orchard core and am getting &quot;The provided connection string is invalid or server is unreachable.&quot; This occurs when I use a remote sql connection or localhost. My database is created in sql already. I am using the sa login Connection Strings I have tried include (I use a custom port for security and 1433 is not active); 1. Server=sql.gsa.land,2990;Database=GSA;User Id=sa;Password=mypwd 2. Server=localhost;Database=GSA;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true The same result occurs if I run the VS 2022 project on my machine or on the web server as in the 2. connection string example. The database is right there and very reachable. My &quot;Recipe&quot; is &quot;Agency&quot; as it really is just a test website. I have setup the website in IIS and assigned a folder. The established app pool is core compliant using 'No Managed Code' I am already running .net core sites so all hosting components are fine. I am using a specific user; Administrator in the App Pool Does anyone have any ideas on how to resolve this?. I did not think I would be stuck at the setup page..... Thankyou for your time!</DESCRIPTION>
