  <TITLE>Can't take screenshot. The image &quot;&lt;url to screenshot file&gt;&quot; cannot be displayed because it contains errors.</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello! Thank you for awesome software! Unfortunately I faced some problem with taking screenshots, I hope you can help me. When I try to take a screenshot, I see an icon which shows screenshot image is not available: ![torn_minicap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12827469/8823163/26704b46-3084-11e5-93b0-372b8676a4a5.png) When I try to click this image, I see following error message in a new browser tab: `The image &quot;http://&lt;my-ip&gt;:7100/s/image/5aac3806-8ba7-4f29-bc49-1bcc1f28dede/&lt;deviceName&gt;.jpg&quot; cannot be displayed because it contains errors.` I tried to download image by url, and noticed image is just empty file(0 bytes size). Stf is launched in &quot;local&quot; mode on my ubuntu 14.04 desktop like this: `stf local --public-ip &lt;my-ip&gt;` [there is no X server running on desktop, if it is important] I am trying to take screenshot from my laptop So, in console log I noticed following messages: `INF/device:plugins:screen:capture 25422 [&lt;deviceName&gt;] Capturing screenshot INF/storage:temp 25341 [*] Uploaded &quot;&lt;deviceName&gt;.jpg&quot; to &quot;/tmp/upload_04db85c0a0bff470298192dcaffd7049&quot; INF/device:support:storage 25422 [&lt;deviceName&gt;] Uploaded to &quot;/s/image/5aac3806-8ba7-4f29-bc49-1bcc1f28dede/&lt;deviceName&gt;.jpg&quot; ` I checked the file `/tmp/upload_04db85c0a0bff470298192dcaffd7049` and found my screenshot.</DESCRIPTION>
