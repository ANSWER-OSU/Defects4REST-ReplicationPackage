  <TITLE>Frame freezes when a screenshot is taken.</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi, at first, I'am writing my master thesis about remote controlling a smartphone for a german automotive company and we're amazed how capable your solution is compared to the other solutions there are considering they all cost a lot of money. Especially your capabilities for manual testing! They are miles better then every solution I looked into. Maybe we are missing one or two features but the rest ist amazing. It could happen that we will try to develop them in house and we are willing to share them with you. Right now I'am evaluating this scenario and calculating the possible costs for one or two small features and a big feature like Appium integration or iOS support. I wil discuss my results with my higher ups and can give you a feedback if you want to. Right now we're testing your solution with serveral employees who are doing manuel application test for one of our costumers. We got a very postive feedback. But there is one big issue. I don't know if it's a problem with our hubs (the plugable hubs are ordered) or if it's a bug: Every time we want to take a screenshot with &quot;right click&quot; on the screen and &quot;Save Screenshot&quot; the screen freezes and we must refresh the page to control the smartphone again. Is it a known bug or is it a problem on our configuration. We're running STF on a ubuntu server on a ESXi host with stf version 1.0.10. I can't see any errors in the server logs. Oh and I actually talked to the CTO of Testobject and he mentioned he was/is in touch with you guys. For more information we may write a personal message. Thank you for your amazing work and your help! Kind regards Felix Hahn</DESCRIPTION>
