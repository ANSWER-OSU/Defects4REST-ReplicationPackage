  <TITLE>Add query to dashboard based on name not query id</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>When adding a new query to a dashboard, you must remember the query id (only visible by going to the URL) rather than searching for possible queries by name (using some kind of auto-complete field or similar), which would be more intuitive and involve less searching back and forth.</DESCRIPTION>
