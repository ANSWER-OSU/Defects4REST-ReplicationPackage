  <TITLE>Multiple Redash users with the same email-id</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>- Currently in the Redash code, It is possible to create multiple users with the same email-id, because email is not case insensitive. - For example It is possible to create two users like InFo@reDaSh.io and INFO@REDASH.IO, Now when we try to login through Google Auth, Redash gets email id as info@redash.io which matches with none of the emails ( InFo@reDaSh.io and INFO@REDASH.IO ). This issue has been the source of several login failures at our company.</DESCRIPTION>
