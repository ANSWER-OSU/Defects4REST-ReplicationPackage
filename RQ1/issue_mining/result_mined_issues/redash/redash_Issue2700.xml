  <TITLE>Update CHANGELOG for v5.0.0-beta</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The next release is going to be `v5`, and as preparation going to package `v5.0.0-beta`. Before doing so, need to update the CHANGELOG. Below are all the merged pull requests since v4.0.1 (which should be pretty much all the significant changes). Now we need: - [x] Sort them into categories: `Added`/`Changed`/`Fixed`/`Other`. - [x] (NTH) update names to their GitHub nicknames (I pulled the names from the Git log). - [x] Rephrase the change description to something friendly (when needed).</DESCRIPTION>
