  <TITLE>Is there any way to revert back to Highcharts ?</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I understand that Plot.ly is open-source but is there anyway that I can still use 0.9.x but switch to Highcharts for graph plotting as it has several features that currently missed from Plot.ly implementation ? Thanks.</DESCRIPTION>
