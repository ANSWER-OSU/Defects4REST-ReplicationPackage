When the the funnel visualization has too many stages it overlaps the filter selection widget. Parameter widgets are unaffected because Redash displays them _above_ the visualization. I reproduced on the preview instance [here](https://redash-preview.netlify.app/queries/390?p_num=0#674). ![Screen Shot 2020-06-23 at 16 42 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17067911/85467275-9f316300-b570-11ea-8c8c-ebf86337fb34.png) ### Steps to Reproduce 1.
