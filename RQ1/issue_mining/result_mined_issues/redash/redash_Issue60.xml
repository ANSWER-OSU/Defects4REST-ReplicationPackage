  <TITLE>Can't save draft queries without publishing them</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>#### Problem Can’t save draft queries with titles. Once a query gets a title, it becomes public. #### Solution An explicit ‘draft’ state for queries, in which they are only visible to their authors. Note that re:dash is aimed at sharable data and should prevent private data silos. The UI should encourage the user to get out of ‘draft’ ASAP (maybe with a drafts quota and/or publishing drafts after a set time period).</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Add --overwrite option to setup.sh (#60) Up until now the setup.sh script automatically deletes any existing environment file in /opt/redash/env, which has caught out numerous people and is a source of issues. From now onwards, an existing environment file will be kept, with only missing mandatory fields added to it to help ensure a working configuration. This commit also introduces a new --overwrite parameter to setup.sh, which tells it to completely overwrite any existing environment file and its matching database. DO NOT use the new --overwrite option if you want to keep your existing database, is it WILL cause your database to be replaced with an empty new one.</MESSAGE>
