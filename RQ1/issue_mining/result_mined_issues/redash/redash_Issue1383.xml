  <TITLE>Share access permissions for add/remove widgets</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hi @arikfr , in our PR #1113 we focused primarily on sharing access permissions for queries, and for dashboards we currently only allow to modify basic info of the dashboard. What is still missing is ability to allow other users to add and remove widgets. Is that something you are planning to add, or should we give it a shot? Another thing that came up - we're currently enforcing `require_admin_or_owner(...)` for managing access permissions (e.g., https://github.com/getredash/redash/blob/master/redash/handlers/permissions.py#L42). This is actually a very restrictive limitation, and we believe that anybody with permissions (owner, admin, other permitted users) should be able to add/remove users. For instance, if you consider person A creating a dashboard, then giving access to persons B and C who are actively maintaining that dashboard. Then, if person A leaves the company, B and C would not be able to make the required changes to add another person D. What do you think? /cc @rohanpd</DESCRIPTION>
