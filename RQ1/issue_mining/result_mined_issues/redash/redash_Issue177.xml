  <TITLE>Suggestion: Dashboard-level formatting and description</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>1. Would be useful to have a general description for an entire dashboard (not for each individual chart). That way you can explain the purpose of this dashboard. 2. Ability to add sections in a dashboard. Each section will be defined by a Heading, A short description for THAT section (see above), and the graphs. This could be edited either as another &quot;graph&quot; in the drag &amp; drop layout editor that currently exists, or via a textual formatter (see #3 markdown). 3. Even better, allow power-users to manually edit a dashboard's layout using a markdown or similar editor. This will allow creating rich dashboards which are self-explanatory and possibly include images, &quot;static&quot; tables etc - all in one place.</DESCRIPTION>
