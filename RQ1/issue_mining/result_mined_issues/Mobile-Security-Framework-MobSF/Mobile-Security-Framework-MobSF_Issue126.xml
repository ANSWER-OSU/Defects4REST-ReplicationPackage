  <TITLE>API Fuzzer: bug replace codecs with io</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>https://github.com/ajinabraham/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/blob/55f42771b1992e1d27519bd6a431ddf11c81eb0c/DynamicAnalyzer/pyWebProxy/pywebproxy.py#L88 The problem is due to a bug in the &quot;codec&quot; library that detects the character &quot;F4&quot; and assumes this is the first character of a sequence of characters and wait to receive the remaining 3 bytes, and the resulting string is truncated. A better and safer approach would be to read the entire stream and only then proceed to the decoding phase, as done by the ”io” module. ref: https://www.owasp.org/images/c/cb/OWASP_Romania_Branca.pdf page 29</DESCRIPTION>
