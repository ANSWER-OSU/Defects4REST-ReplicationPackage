  <TITLE>search by accounting code with virtual zero</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Feature Request When i want to search products with virtual zero like 7060 in products accounting from comptaiblité module, j'ai un resultat vide. This seems normal to me because its virtual zero (only visible to the user) that are added at the end of my accounting numbers. Except that many users do not know this subtilety. It will be good to manage the problem in the search when the conf of virtual zeros is enabled in order to avoid this misunderstanding. ### Use case _No response_ ### Suggested implementation We could delete the additional 0 when searching from a field of type accounting code. ### Suggested steps _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
