  <TITLE>Bug: Inssurance of a loan not properly taken when there are decimals - Loan</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Bug Version: 20.0.2 Hello, I have created a loan and I had forgotten to add the price of the insurance of the loan. So I edit the loan and change the value of the insurance by 12,70 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09410cbd-195c-4683-97fe-cbed75273737) After validation of the change, the insurance is 12,00€ instead of 12,70€ ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40fd4faf-b7bd-4d16-bb2a-2e98cea45e94) Also when I edit the loan there are two small problems: - A dot is used to separate the decimals but when I'm not in edit mode it's a coma (coma is what I want in both cases) - There are too many zeros for decimals, you can see on the screeshot 75989.000000, but 75989,00 should be expected.
