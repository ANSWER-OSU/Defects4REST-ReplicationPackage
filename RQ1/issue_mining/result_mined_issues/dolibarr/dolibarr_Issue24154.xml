  <TITLE>Entrepôt - Description adds linebreak at every Save</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Bug At Save, a &lt;br/&gt; tag is added to every line in the Description field in Entrepôt ### Environment Version 16.0.3 ### Environment OS Debian Linux 11 ### Environment Web server Apache ### Environment PHP 7.4 ### Environment Database Maria DB ### Environment URL(s) /htdocs/product/stock/card.php ### Expected and actual behavior At Save, no html linebreak tags `&lt;br/&gt;` should be added, but they are added for every line at Save. ### Steps to reproduce the behavior Create an Entrepôt and write 2 or more lines in the Description field.

This happends every time the Entrepôt card is opend and svaved This is what Source looks like before Save ``` Contact:&amp;nbsp;Mr.XXX- Phone-No.: +49 9999999&lt;br /&gt; The best references for our colleagues in the warehouse are the order confirmation numbers. ``` This is what it looks like after 1 Save ``` Contact:&amp;nbsp;Mr.XXX- Phone-No.: +49 9999999&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The best references for our colleagues in the warehouse are the order confirmation numbers. ``` And this is what it looks like after 2 Saves ``` Contact:&amp;nbsp;Mr.XXX- Phone-No.: +49 9999999&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The best references for our colleagues in the warehouse are the order confirmation numbers. ``` And so on ..... ### Attached files _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
