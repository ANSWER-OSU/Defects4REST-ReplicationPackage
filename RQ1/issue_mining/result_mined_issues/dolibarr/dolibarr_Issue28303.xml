  <TITLE>Solved or closed ticket should automatically open by Email Collecter module upon further email from customer</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Feature Request Email collector module doesn't re-open after getting further reply via email from customer email. ### Use case Generally ticket are closed by organizational employee after the problem is solved. Now the same ticket can be opened by the customer after reply on the same ticket after few days. Dolibarr adds the new message using the help of Email Collector Class to closed ticket, but don't re-open the ticket again automatically. ### Suggested implementation Upon collecting response by **Collect_Responses_In**, closed or solved ticket should be re-opened. Other wise employee would not know about the new reply. If the ticket is not assigned, then the re-opened ticket status should be **Unread**. And if the ticket is assigned, then the re-opened ticket status should be **Assigned**. ### Suggested steps _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
