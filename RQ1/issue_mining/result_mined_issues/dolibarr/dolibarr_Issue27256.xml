  <TITLE>BOM show product thumb in header</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Feature Request In products when a jpg or png is uploaded this is shown in the card.php has a thumb nail. In the BOM this is not the case. As a BOM is in most cases just a product it would be nice to see a picture: ![product-thumb](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/assets/7335299/b260879f-3e49-4ced-939b-b33ac3116d2d) versus ![product-thumb-2](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/assets/7335299/a73a37ab-7e52-4ea4-87c6-ff8dd56cad35) ### Use case Especially when a lot of sub-boms are used its good to know which part those BOM's is referring to of the total product ### Suggested implementation _No response_ ### Suggested steps _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
