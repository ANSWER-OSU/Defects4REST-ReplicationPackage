  <DESCRIPTION>### Bug After uptating from 17.0.3 to 18.0.3 after updating from 17.0.3 to 18.0.3 delivery receipt could be issued but when click in the same sales order again there is no delivery receipt nor tab and i have to create another one the folder permission is correct as i can create and find the related file moreover in shipments-&gt;list the column [Ref Delivery] is empty. It used to show and link to the delivery receipt Please note as well that tab “delivery receipt” is no more translated (we use Italian) and shown as “stock receipt”. In addition the list of shipments shows the same expedition as many times as per every delivery receipt created. this issue appears on fresh intallation as well in 18.0.3 and 19.0 more on this [https://www.dolibarr.org/forum/t/delivery-receipt-could-not-saved-after-updating/24245](https://www.dolibarr.org/forum/t/delivery-receipt-could-not-saved-after-updating/24245) ### Environment Version 18.0.1 + ### Environment OS freeBSD 12.4 ### Environment Web server apache ### Environment PHP 8.1 ### Environment Database 10.6-MariaDB ### Environment URL(s) _No response_ ### Expected and actual behavior _No response_ ### Steps to reproduce the behavior update from 17.0.3 to 18.0.3 or fresh installation `git clone https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr.git cd dolibarr git checkout 18.0` testing with 18.0.3 testing with 19.0 `git checkout develop` ### Attached files _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
