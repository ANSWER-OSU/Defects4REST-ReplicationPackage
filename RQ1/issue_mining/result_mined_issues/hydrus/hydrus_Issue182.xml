  <TITLE>Port number is not specified for server endpoint URL</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### I'm submitting a - [x] bug report. ### Current Behaviour: The port number is not specified for the API endpoint URL the server is exposed to. It may lead to a scenario where the client is unable to find the server or try to access a different program in the host machine. ### Expected Behaviour: The port number of the server endpoint should be specified in the server URL so that client is able to connect to the server without any errors. ### Steps to reproduce: - Run an instance of the hydrus server any port (the default `8080` also works) - Access it using a hydra enabled client with specifying the port number (e.g `http:127.0.0.1:8080/localhost` - It will not be able to find the rest of the resources apart from that which is present at `http:127.0.0.1:8080/localhost` ### Do you want to work on this issue? yes</DESCRIPTION>

      <MESSAGE>Add default port for utils.set_hydrus_server_url() With this patch the server is now able to set proper absolute paths which contains the port number also. For using this feature, user will have to first invoke `set_hydrus_server_url()` within the app context. Fixes #182</MESSAGE>
