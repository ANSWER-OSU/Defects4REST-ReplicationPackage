  <TITLE>Test data option</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I have the system up and running but I have yet to connect to the Dexcom (because it is with my daughter at camp :) ). Even with that not being the case, I think it would be very cool to modify the doReadAndUpload to check for a useTestData flag and send some garbage data from the android app to the cloud so that we can test prior to taking the final step of connecting to the Dex. Overall, I am really psyched about this!!</DESCRIPTION>
