  <TITLE>Profile Editor uses server-side clock format settings</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The CGM visualization component allows user to set between 12 and 24 hour clocks on the client side, but the profile editor only uses the server-side setting to change between 12 and 24 hour clocks. Should probably refactor the editor to use the client setting (which in turn uses the server side as the default).</DESCRIPTION>
