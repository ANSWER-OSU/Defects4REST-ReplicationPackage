  <TITLE>All treatments ever entered are downloaded for display in the chart</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Even for the `wip/iob-cob` branch we only should download 4 or 5 days Also there's currently a lot of code in `wip/iob-cob` that is splicing the array to only look at the last 200 treatments. This should be fixed in the mainline with extra cleanup in `wip/iob-cob` after merge</DESCRIPTION>
