  <TITLE>[feature]: Slash command: callout</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Summary `/callout` To generate a textblock with a colored background (optionally set an icon). https://redgregory.notion.site/Callout-1163474c7cbb41fa9e1b41ec01c6fcd6 https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/info-tip-note-and-warning-macros-51872369.html ### Why should this be worked on? Both notion &amp; JIRA have this, it's a good way of adding noticeable context to a page. Let's say you add a red call out with a warning sign -&gt; makes it clear there's a warning about something on the ticket/page also works for blue/info sign, other variants serve their own purpose. You could either: - offer presets (info, warning, danger, success) - Allow users to choose color (and optionally an icon)</DESCRIPTION>
