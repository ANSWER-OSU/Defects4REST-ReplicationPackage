  <TITLE>[bug]: &quot;See more&quot; is a broken link for &quot;Allow Plane to anonymously collect usage events.&quot; on setup form</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [x] I have searched the existing issues ### Current behavior I think the correct url is https://developers.plane.so/self-hosting/telemetry, but that component currently points to https://docs.plane.so/telemetry, which 404s. ### Steps to reproduce 1. install self-host plane instance 2. go to initial setup screen http://your_url/god-mode/ 3. verify that `Allow Plane to anonymously collect usage events. [See More](https://docs.plane.so/telemetry)` points to https://docs.plane.so/telemetry, which is a broken link ### Environment Production ### Browser None ### Variant Self-hosted ### Version v0.24.1</DESCRIPTION>
