  <TITLE>[feature]: Add ability to close/complete a project</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Summary Allow the ability to &quot;complete&quot; a project so that it no longer appears in my sidebar/metrics but I can still pull it up as an archive for reference if I ever need to pull any of those details back. ### Why should this be worked on? Projects do eventually complete. At that point it is no longer useful to have it referenced in my metrics or dashboards, but it is nice to be able to look back at the completed issues/pages for future reference in case another project is started with that customer or decision points/actions are called into question later.</DESCRIPTION>
