  <TITLE>[feature]: Extensive Table Support in editor</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Summary Add comprehensive table support to the editor, enhancing the editor's capabilities and user experience. Key features include creating tables using Slash commands, resizable columns, row/column header toggling, a unified table menu, and compatibility with copy-pasting tables from Sheets, Excel, and Numbers. ### Why should this be worked on? 1. Improved functionality: Adding table support will significantly enhance Tiptap's capabilities, allowing users to create and manage tables with ease. 2. Better user experience: The proposed features, such as resizable columns and row/column header toggling, will provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience when working with tables in Tiptap. 3. Seamless integration: Compatibility with copy-pasting tables from popular spreadsheet applications like Sheets, Excel, and Numbers will enable users to easily import and work with existing data. 4. Increased adoption: By offering comprehensive table support, the editor will become a more attractive option for users seeking a feature-rich and versatile text editor.</DESCRIPTION>
