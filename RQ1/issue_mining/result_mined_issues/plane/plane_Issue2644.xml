  <TITLE>Trying Plane</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>I found your software some time ago. I don't remember when. I may have created [this space](https://app.plane.so/sol). I'd like to use software more helpful than Atlassian Work and Height. You say Plane is better. I'd like to try it. I've just tried to create this space. Plane responded: &quot;Workspace URL is already taken!&quot; Did I create this space? a. Yes. Let me use it! b. No. I'll choose another URL.</DESCRIPTION>
