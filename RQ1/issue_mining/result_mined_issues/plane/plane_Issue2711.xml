  <TITLE>[feature]: Users should be logged in for longer and have to enter passwords less frequently</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Summary On my self-hosted instance (version: v0.13.2) I have to log in several times a day (desktop and mobile), for example after restarting the PC. The site should be usable for longer without the need to log in. ### Why should this be worked on? The need to log in repeatedly leads to frustration among users, as this is perceived as an effort and an unnecessary step. People often take the easiest route and therefore prefer to have to enter their login details infrequently. Prominent examples are Google and Amazon - passwords only need to be re-entered for security-relevant actions.</DESCRIPTION>
