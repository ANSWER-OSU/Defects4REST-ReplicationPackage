  <TITLE>[feature]: Add roles and permissions</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Summary We propose the implementation of a fine-grained permissions system within your project management software. This feature would provide users with the ability to control access and actions at a detailed level, improving security and ensuring that only authorized individuals can make specific changes to tasks, cycles, and other elements of the project. State Change Authorization: Users should have the ability to specify who can change the state of a task or cycle. This means that only specific individuals or roles are allowed to transition items between different states, ensuring that these transitions are controlled and accountable. Property Modification Control: The fine-grained permissions system should enable administrators or task owners to restrict access to certain properties of a task or cycle. For example, only specific users should be able to modify critical properties like due dates, priority levels, or associated team members. Role-Based Permissions: This system should support role-based permissions, allowing organizations to define different roles (e.g., admins, managers, contributors) and assign specific permissions to each role. This ensures that access and control are aligned with users' responsibilities. Customization: Users should be able to customize permissions at a granular level, specifying who can view, edit, or delete specific elements within a task or cycle, including comments, attachments, and other metadata. ### Why should this be worked on? Benefits: Enhanced security: Users can control access and actions, reducing the risk of unauthorized changes or data breaches. Accountability: The fine-grained permissions system ensures that state changes and property modifications are attributed to specific individuals or roles. Customizability: Organizations can tailor the permissions system to their unique workflow, ensuring it aligns with their project management needs. Conclusion: The addition of a fine-grained permissions system is a significant step toward providing users with a more secure and customizable project management experience. It addresses the need for controlled access and accountability, enabling organizations to manage their projects with greater precision and confidence. We believe that this feature would greatly benefit users and contribute to the overall effectiveness of your platform. Please consider implementing this feature to further enhance the capabilities of your project management software. Your users will appreciate the added flexibility and security that a fine-grained permissions system offers.</DESCRIPTION>
