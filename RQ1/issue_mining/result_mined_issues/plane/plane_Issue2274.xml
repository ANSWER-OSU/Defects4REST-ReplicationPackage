  <TITLE>[bug]: issue calendar view not properly display all tasks</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Current behavior When I have added issues that include either/both start dates and due dates, not all issues are shown on the calendar view nor are those that are shown in the correct day. For example, issues with a start and due date of September 27 are shown in the box for September 26, while other issues (with due dates later than September 27) are not shown at all. I am unsure if this has something to do with the bug related to selecting dates being one off of the desired date ( [bug]: Date picker select is always off by one day #1992 ). ### Steps to reproduce 1. Create new task with start and due date set to &quot;tomorrow&quot; (in my case Set 27). 2. Create another task with a due date that is later than &quot;tomorrow&quot; 3. Select calendar view ### Browser Mozilla Firefox ### Version Cloud</DESCRIPTION>
