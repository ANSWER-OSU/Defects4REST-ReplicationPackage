  <TITLE>Release v0.12</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues ### Summary I see that the milestone for v0.12.x is complete: https://github.com/makeplane/plane/milestone/1 I’ve been looking forward to trying out a new version of Plane, but I cannot see any v0.12. Several development intermediary versions have been released both for v0.12 and v0.13, are there still blocking issues that gate the release of v0.12? Maybe you plan on releasing v0.13 directly? Note that I self-host Plane and rely on the Docker images. Thanks! ### Why should this be worked on? Transparency of the workflow and current objectives.</DESCRIPTION>
