  <TITLE>Heartbeat Retry Interval time (seconds) not working</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Is it a duplicate question?** No. **Describe the bug** I noticed this issue since 1.7.0, but I was unsure it was a configuration error from my side or a bug... The setting Heartbeat Retry Interval time in seconds is not working. Screenshot settings: ![uk_scr1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8298741/135231959-99276ec2-bffe-4ce3-aa25-7faf7de34552.png) When a service goes down, it should retry 3 times every 60 seconds before it sends a notification the service is down. **Screencapture**: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8298741/135232370-e0cd2714-80dc-4c39-beb8-39badebf913e.mp4 As you can see in this screencapture, all three (3) Heartbeat Retries are send within one (1) minute and the service is marked as down. **Expected behavior** Retries: 3 Heartbeat Retry Interval: 60 Send 3 heartbeats every 60 seconds before the service is marked as down and a notification is sent. **Info** Uptime Kuma Version: 1.7.0. Using Docker?: Yes OS: Ubuntu 21.04 Browser: Chrome</DESCRIPTION>
