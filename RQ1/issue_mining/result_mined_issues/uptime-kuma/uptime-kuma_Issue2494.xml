  <DESCRIPTION>### ⚠️ Please verify that this bug has NOT been raised before. - [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue ### ️ Security Policy - [X] I agree to have read this project [Security Policy](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/policy) ### Description When adding a new manual maintenance, removing it while active does not remove it from the active status pages ### Reproduction steps Go to the maintenance panel. Click &quot;Schedule Maintenance&quot; Give it a name, select at least one monitor Tick &quot;All Status Pages&quot; Use strategy: &quot;Active/Inactive Manually&quot; &quot;Save&quot; The maintenance is now active. Go on one of your status pages, the maintenance is active. Go back to the maintenance page. &quot;Delete&quot; the maintenance ### Expected behavior The maintenance should disappear on affected status pages ### Actual Behavior The maintenance is still here. Adding any other active maintenance removes it however. ### Uptime-Kuma Version 1.19.2 ### Operating System and Arch Manjaro, kernel:5.10.161-1-MANJARO ### Browser Firefox Developer Edition 109.0b6 ### Docker Version Docker 20.10.22 ### NodeJS Version 16.18.1 ### Relevant log output _No response_ #### EDIT: It is removed but it takes some time before updating, I must have checked a bit longer.</DESCRIPTION>
