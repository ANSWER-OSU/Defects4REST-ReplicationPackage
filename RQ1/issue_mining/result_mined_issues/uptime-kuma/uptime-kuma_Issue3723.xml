  <TITLE>Timezone Issue Causes Incorrect Monitor Time Display</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### ⚠️ Please verify that this bug has NOT been raised before. - [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue ### ️ Security Policy - [X] I agree to have read this project [Security Policy](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/policy) ### Describe your problem Environment: Uptime Kuma Version: 1.23.1 OS: Ubuntu 22.04 Database: MariaDB Issue: I've encountered an issue where the monitor time displayed in Uptime Kuma is incorrect. The time initially appears correct but later jumps forward by 2 hours. I've confirmed that the server's timezone and MariaDB's timezone are both correctly set to 'Europe/Berlin'. Logs: The following warning appears in the logs: `Ignoring invalid timezone passed to Connection: UTC. This is currently a warning, but in future versions of MySQL2, an error will be thrown if you pass an invalid configuration option t&gt;` This log entry coincides with the time jump in the Uptime Kuma interface. Steps to Reproduce: - Install Uptime Kuma on a server with the 'Europe/Berlin' timezone. - Set up a monitor. - Observe the time displayed for the monitor. Expected Behavior: The monitor time should be consistent with the server's timezone setting. Actual Behavior: The monitor time jumps forward by 2 hours after a short period. Additional Information: I've tried modifying the MariaDB configuration to set the global timezone, but the issue persists. ### Error Message(s) or Log _No response_ ### Uptime-Kuma Version 1.23.1 ### Operating System and Arch Ubuntu 22.04 ### Browser Chrome 116.0.5845.142 ### Docker Version _No response_ ### NodeJS Version 16.20.2</DESCRIPTION>
