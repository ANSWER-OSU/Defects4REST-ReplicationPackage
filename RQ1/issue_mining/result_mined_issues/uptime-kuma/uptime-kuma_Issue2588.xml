  <TITLE>Notifications via a proxy (squid)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### ⚠️ Please verify that this feature request has NOT been suggested before. - [X] I checked and didn't find similar feature request ### ️ Feature Request Type Other ### Feature description Telegram (axios.get) and teams (axios.post) use neither the system-wide proxy (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY) nor a separately defined one such as in the .npmrc (proxy, https-proxy). The extension of the respective axios calls in teams.js or telegram.js with the proxy address (https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios &gt; `axios#post(url[, data[, config]])`) also fails because the request doesn't arrive at the Squid with `request_method=CONNECT`. The webhooks for Telegram and teams via the squid work as desired via curl. ### ✔️ Solution The general use of the system variables (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`) for the installation (`download-dist.js`), the actual monitoring (already works via the `http-proxy-agent` module) and the notifications (notification-providers) would make sense. ### ❓ Alternatives _No response_ ### Additional Context I was able to get the download to run as part of the installation using the 'https-proxy-agent' module in download-dist.js. I couldn't get Axios to work with the Squid.</DESCRIPTION>
