Create a monitor with http url 2. Add the monitor to a status page 3. Enable &quot;Show Certificate Expiry&quot; for that status page ### Expected behavior No badge is shown for http monitors. ### Actual Behavior A red badge with the text &quot;Cert Exp.: No/Bad Certificate&quot; is shown for a monitor with an http address. This looks like there's an error, but it's expected to have no certificate when it's http only. ### Uptime-Kuma Version 1.23.1 ### Operating System and Arch Docker ### Browser Firefox ### Docker Version _No response_ ### NodeJS Version _No response_ ### Relevant log output _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
