  <TITLE>Please show something more than a blank page when the user has JavaScript disabled</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### ⚠️ Please verify that this feature request has NOT been suggested before. - [X] I checked and didn't find similar feature request ### ️ Feature Request Type UI Feature ### Feature description Please show something other than a blank page when the user has JavaScript disabled. ### ✔️ Solution At least some kind of `&lt;noscript&gt;` message that tells the user they need to enable JavaScript. Even better would be if the page could display at least some status information rendered server-side as well. ### ❓ Alternatives _No response_ ### Additional Context The f-droid.org website is designed to work without JavaScript, as many of our users are very privacy/security-conscious. Ideally, our status page would also work without JavaScript, at least partially, or at the very least show some kind of message other than a blank screen.</DESCRIPTION>
