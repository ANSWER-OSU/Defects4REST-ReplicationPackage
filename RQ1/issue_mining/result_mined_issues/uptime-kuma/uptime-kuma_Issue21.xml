  <TITLE>Enhancements</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>First of all great work! Looks really awesome. Though I have a few enhancement requests to make it even greater! - [x] Select all monitors at once to pause them: at the moment you have to pause them all manually one by one - [x] Scheduled pausing: for scheduled maintenance, server reboot etc (https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/191) - [x] Retries: for instance 3 retries in xx seconds before a service is being marked as down - [x] Accepted HTTP codes: I would like to add status codes to some HTTP request, 401 for instance (#173 ) - [x] Public dashboard: create a status page where monitors can be shown but not edited - [x] 2FA: would be great to have 2FA (Google auth, Authy etc) for logging in with the admin account - [x] Send notification/alert after xx time: have an interval for sending notifications, to avoid small downtimes - [x] Reset/delete up/downtime history: be able to delete the history for a monitor (after history delete it's 100% up again) - [x] Version number on webinterface (thx @rezzorix) - [x] Link to this github page (thx @rezzorix) - [x] Monitor groups: e.g. Server1, Server2 etc. (thx @LeviSnoot) - [x] Re-order monitors: create your own list priority (thx @LeviSnoot) - [x] Combined monitors : A monitor that looks at two instances but is displayed as one and/or has a dropdown to show all contained (thx @LeviSnoot) - [x] Dark mode: based on system settings (thx @LeviSnoot) - [ ] Incident reports: ties into public status page, the ability to write a message relating to the status of a monitor, with a status on each message such as &quot;⛔ Investigating&quot;, &quot;⚠ Resolving&quot; and &quot;✔ Resolved&quot;. (thx @LeviSnoot) (https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/pull/1253) - [x] White labeling public status page with custom logo, page title and favicon - that said there should obviously still be credit to the project, maybe in the form of a footer or something (thx @LeviSnoot) - [ ] Pagination: next page for the Dashboard / Dashboard of each monitor (thx @rezzorix) (https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/4106 https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/2993) - [x] Import/export monitors list as JSON (thx @kvpt) - [x] Add the possibility to define an announcement (thx @kvpt) - [x] Ability to use a separate docker container as the database e.g. mariadb (thx @joe-eklund) - [x] Ability to authenticate with digest or basic auth (thx @joe-eklund) - [x] Heartbeat monitoring, instead of pinging services, those services must check in (thx @joe-eklund) - [x] Able to ignore SSL issues for specific monitors (thx @joe-eklund) - [ ] User management with LDAP and oAuth. This would allow us to use our built in user management tools instead of having to create yet another user for people that need access. (thx @joe-eklund) (#128) - [x] Ability to set default notifications in settings so you don't have to select each time you create a new monitor &quot;Check now&quot; button to perform a check a single monitor right away (thx @parityhero) - [x] Tags to group monitors with filtering: by tag, by type (thx @parityhero) - [ ] More information about monitor: date created, last modified etc. (thx @parityhero) (https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/3481) - [x] Ability to SMTP multiple email addresses or CC/BCC (thx @parityhero) - [ ] Personnalize notifications for texts / icons to be used, depending on private/public channels for example (thx @magicgg91) (#975) - [x] Check certficate validity and expiration time (thx @magicgg91) - [x] Ability to configure how long the monitor history is retained. A global setting to automatically delete monitor entries older than ${x} days would declutter the user interface. (thx @Spiritreader) - [ ] Ability for a &quot;Bulk Upload&quot; via csv etc (thx @EclipseOfficeTech) (https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/4065 https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/2934 https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/1323) Keep up the good work! &lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;updates&lt;/summary&gt; &lt;p&gt; _2021-07-15 @ 3.20pm UTC:_ Formatting changed to checkboxes per request @louislam _2021-07-15 @ 4.00pm UTC:_ Added enhancements requested by @kvpt _2021-07-17 @ 8.00am UTC:_ Added enhancements requested by @joe-eklund _2021-07-19 @ 8.02am UTC:_ Added enhancements requested by @parityhero _2021-07-21 @ 9.04am UTC:_ Added enhancements requested by @magicgg91 _2021-07-29 @ 1.40pm UTC:_ Added enhancements requested by @Spiritreader &amp; @EclipseOfficeTech _2023-12-01 @ 17.20pm UTC:_ Updated the todo list by @CommanderStorm &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt;</DESCRIPTION>
