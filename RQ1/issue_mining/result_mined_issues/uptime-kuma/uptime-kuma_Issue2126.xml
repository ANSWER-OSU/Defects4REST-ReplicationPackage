  <TITLE>Hardcoded ping executable path</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### ⚠️ Please verify that this bug has NOT been raised before. - [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue ### ️ Security Policy - [X] I agree to have read this project [Security Policy](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/policy) ### Description The ping binary path is hardcoded in this file : https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/443235b20b9db8fab84f2bf580bf50fbaa3a53c6/server/ping-lite.js#L35 Is there a reason hardcoded path are used instead of relying on the environment ? This assumes compliance with the linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard which is not always the case. For example NixOS stores all the executables in /nix/store/. If there is no specific reason, I could try to adapt this file and submit it as a PR. ### Reproduction steps / ### Expected behavior Utime-kuma ping monitor is working correctly. ### Actual Behavior Uptime-kuma complains the the ping binary is not installed. ### Uptime-Kuma Version 1.18 ### Operating System and Arch NixOS 22.05 ### Browser Firefox ### Docker Version _No response_ ### NodeJS Version _No response_ ### Relevant log output _No response_</DESCRIPTION>

    <MESSAGE>Added #2182 Add support for custom radius ports (#2197) This commit adds support for the port to be specified when using the radius monitor type. A check has been implemented to ensure that a null value is not passed to the radius check function as could occur with monitors that were created before this change was introduced. The default port of 1812 is displayed when the user selects the radius monitor in much the same way as the DNS port is handled. The port was not included in the hostname in the form hostname:port in order to avoid issues with IPv6 addresses and monitors that had been created before this change was implemented.
