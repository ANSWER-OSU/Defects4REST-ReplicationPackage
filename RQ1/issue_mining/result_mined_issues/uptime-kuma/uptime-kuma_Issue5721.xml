  <TITLE>v2 beta- Proxy port out of range error for Mariadb (port = 40000)</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### I have found these related issues/pull requests I did not find a related issue ### ️ Security Policy - [x] I agree to have read this project [Security Policy](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/policy) ### Description I am using v2 beta version with MariaDB embedded, and when I try to create (insert) or update a proxy with a 40000 port value (a real value used by Oxylabs to provide residential IPs in certain countries), it is shown a red error that states &quot;update `proxy` set `user_id` = 1, `protocol` = 'https', `host` = 'XXXXXX', `port` = 40000, `auth` = true, `username` = 'XXXXXX', `password` = 'XXXXXX', `active` = true, `default` = false, `created_date` = '2025-03-19 11:51:59' where `id` = 9 - **Out of range value for column 'port' at row 1**&quot; (error shown when trying to update a proxy's port) I guess the reason is that the port value is defined as a 16 bit integer somewhere (max value = 32767) causing this error. ### Reproduction steps 1. Go to settings --&gt; Proxies 2. Edit an existing one (or create a new one) 3. Enter the values, including a port that is higher than 32767 (actually I tested that this value does not cause errors but 32768 does) 4. Click save ### Expected behavior It does not trigger any error and the proxy is properly saved ### Actual Behavior It returns an error like this one: &quot;update `proxy` set `user_id` = 1, `protocol` = 'https', `host` = 'XXXXXX', `port` = 40000, `auth` = true, `username` = 'XXXXXX', `password` = 'XXXXXX', `active` = true, `default` = false, `created_date` = '2025-03-19 11:51:59' where `id` = 9 - Out of range value for column 'port' at row 1&quot; ### Uptime-Kuma Version beta 2.0 ### Operating System and Arch Ubuntu 20.04 ### Browser Google Chrome Version 134.0.6998.89 ### ️ Deployment Environment - Runtime: Docker 20.10.9 - Database: embedded mariadb - Filesystem used to store the database on: AWS EFS NFSv3 - number of monitors: 80 ### Relevant log output ```shell ```</DESCRIPTION>
