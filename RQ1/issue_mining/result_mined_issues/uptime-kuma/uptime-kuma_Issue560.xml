  <TITLE>Label cant't fit in the &quot;pill&quot; margins</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>**Is it a duplicate question?** Can't find another one, maybe because it is language specific. **Info** Uptime Kuma Version: 1.7.3 Using Docker?: Yes Docker Version: 20.10.8 OS: Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10 Browser: Firefox, Chrome **The Problem** On language where the word for &quot;Down&quot; is a bit longer, the text can't fit in the &quot;red pill&quot; margins on the Dashboard. **Visual representation** ![uptime-kuma-issue-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66828538/135970507-72eb0473-057e-44f4-81dd-2f9e613a5c80.jpg) I don't think it's a bug, that's why i put the &quot;help&quot; label. **Questions** - Do I need to find a shorter word and change it in the `bg-BG.js` language file? Or, - Is it possible for someone with skills to make the &quot;red pill&quot; bigger, or some kind of &quot;auto fit&quot; trick, if it is not very time consuming?</DESCRIPTION>
