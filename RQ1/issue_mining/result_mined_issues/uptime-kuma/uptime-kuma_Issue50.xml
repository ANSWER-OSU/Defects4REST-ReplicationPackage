  <TITLE>Enhancement: Gotify priorities</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Thanks for releasing with the Gotify PR included so soon! Makes it easier a lot - I had used Webhook to NodeRed and from there relayed to my Gotify as a workaround in the meantime. As commented on the Commit already, I'd really love to see priorities being supported. I use different notification classes in the Gotify Android App. This way I could react on critical failures fast, while not getting woken up by minor things in the night (just an example ;)) Thx!</DESCRIPTION>
