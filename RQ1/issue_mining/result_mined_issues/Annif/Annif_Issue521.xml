  <TITLE>Attempting to use a private project returns &quot;No projects found with id&quot; from inside command line.</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Looking at the documentation of the access settings, it seems that the purpose of hidden projects is to hide them from the UI, but still expose them to the API, and the purpose of private projects is to hide them from any REST API entirely, but still make them usable from within the command line. Instead, making a project private within projects.cfg also makes it unusable from within the command line. I am running annif following the instructions here: https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/wiki/Running-as-a-WSGI-service</DESCRIPTION>
