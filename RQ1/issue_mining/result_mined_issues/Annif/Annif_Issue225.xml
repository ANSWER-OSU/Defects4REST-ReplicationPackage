  <TITLE>Incremental / online learning based on user feedback</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Right now all models are built once and then remain static. But at least for `tfidf` and `pav` backends it would be possible to improve the model over time based on user feedback, i.e. documents that were analyzed, a human reviewed the result and rejected some subjects (false positives) and/or added new ones (false negatives). This issue is about providing the infrastructure for such functionality and the CLI commands and REST API methods. I will open separate issues for adding online learning support for each backend. The CLI command could be annif learn &lt;projectid&gt; &lt;corpus&gt; ~~(still thinking about what would be the best command name, maybe also `increment[al]` or `retrain`)~~ **learn** is fine, used by e.g. Vowpal Wabbit The REST API method could be (for a single command) POST /projects/&lt;projectid&gt;/learn with parameters corresponding to the CLI command. Ensemble style backends (currently `ensemble` and `pav`) should propagate the learn operation first to the source projects, reanalyze the document, and only then update their own model.</DESCRIPTION>
