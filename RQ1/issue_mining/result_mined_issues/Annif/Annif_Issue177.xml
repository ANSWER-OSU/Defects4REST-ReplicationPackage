  <TITLE>Replace load and loaddocs CLI commands with new train command</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The load and loaddocs commands have several problems: * the subject corpus format for `load` is not very good (#176) * there are two separate commands when we could have just one that takes either a file (tsv) or directory (txt+tsv instead of the current subject corpus format - see #145) * it's badly named, as e.g. for fastText it does training as well as loading The current `load` and `loaddocs` commands should be replaced with a new `train` command that takes either a file or a directory.</DESCRIPTION>
