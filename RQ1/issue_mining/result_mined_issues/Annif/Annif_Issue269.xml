  <TITLE>Maui Server backend, including training support</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>The [Maui Server API](https://github.com/TopQuadrant/MauiServer/blob/master/API.md) provides all the important Maui functionality over REST. Annif should have a backend that works with this - either by enhancing the `http` backend or by creating a new `maui` backend. The latter is probably easier, though even the `http` backend could be quite easily made to support at least the basic analyze/suggest case just by making the response handling more robust so it will accept Maui Server responses as well. All the configuration for the Maui Server tagger should go in the Annif `projects.cfg` configuration. There could be a new Annif command `init` (#251) that creates the tagger on the Maui server end, based on the configuration. Possibly it would upload the vocabulary to Maui as well, though then `loadvoc` needs to be executed first. The other (probably better) option would be to add a hook for notifying backends about loading the vocabulary, which would trigger the upload.</DESCRIPTION>
