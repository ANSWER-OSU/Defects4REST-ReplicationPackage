  <TITLE>It would be valuable to document the practical benefit of Elassandra over Elasticsearch</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Traditionally one of the big values of Cassandra over Elasticsearch (ES) was is reliability whereas ES was known to lose data it certain situations. Or it's ability to scale linearly with new nodes. Many of these problems have been solved or improved in newer versions of ES (&gt;5). It would be valuable to document somewhere what benefit I'm going to experience by using Elessandra (EL) over ES. Eg, in these failure situations, EL does not lose data whereas ES does. Or, EL can index/search/update X docs/sec and ES can only do Y. In my mind, having two good products merged into one doesn't automatically make it better - did I inherit the benefits of both or the faults of both (or even more faults..)</DESCRIPTION>
