  <TITLE>2.0.1 setup issues tax calculation shipping h2database persistence xml</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>PersistableCustomerPopulator.java - state was not populated for Billing and Delivery so tax calculation was throw null pointer exception if tax calculation option is set to either shipping of billing address. I am using it in Singapore so zone is empty. If store address is used for tax calculation then it works as zone is present in prepopulated data. Again stateprovince is empty for store too. I am not sure if zone concept is new and there will be maintenance screens developed in admin to populate zones.? TaxServiceImpl.java - comparison with enum SHIPPINGADDRESS, BILLINGADDRESS, STOREADDRESS is not working as STOREADDRESS.name() is not used while doing equals comparison. - if(taxBasisCalculation.name().equals(TaxBasisCalculation.SHIPPINGADDRESS)){ - if(taxBasisCalculation.name().equals(TaxBasisCalculation.SHIPPINGADDRESS.name())){ sm-shop/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/web/utils/LocaleUtils.java - gives MissingResourceException while fetching getISO3Country(). Just wrap the exception in try catch and ignore the exception. sm-shop/src/main/resources/log4j.xml - org.apache.log4j.rolling.RollingFileAppender should be changed to org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender. shopizer-properties.xml - I would suggest to keep prepopulate data on as default as it will help a lot of people to evaluate the product. Just like I was doing. sm-shop/src/main/webapp/pages/shop/templates/bootstrap3/sections/header.jsp - missing taglib inclusion for sm:storeLogo/. Tax, Shipping configuration needs to be done in prepopulated data to run smoothly. H2database - orderBy with language was giving errors saying order by column should be part of select columns, but in mysql it seems to be working. I had to remove all the orderBy language.id portion to make it work. http://www.h2database.com/javadoc/org/h2/constant/ErrorCode.html#c90068 shipping option - while submitting as guest shipping option was coming as null, and this was giving a lot of problems. sm-core/src/main/resources/META-INF/sm-persistence.xml - missing entry - &lt;class&gt;com.salesmanager.core.business.payments.model.Transaction&lt;/class&gt; I am not creating multiple issue requests as I believe these are basic and might have been already fixed. functionality - after order fulfillment I couldn't find the remaining quantity available getting reduced to reflect the number of items delivered. Overall I liked the application but its a bit limited in inventory management and order fulfillment.</DESCRIPTION>
