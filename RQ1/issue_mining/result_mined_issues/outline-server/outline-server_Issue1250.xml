  <TITLE>Security Policy violation Binary Artifacts</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>_This issue was automatically created by [Allstar](https://github.com/ossf/allstar/)._ **Security Policy Violation** Project is out of compliance with Binary Artifacts policy: binaries present in source code **Rule Description** Binary Artifacts are an increased security risk in your repository. Binary artifacts cannot be reviewed, allowing the introduction of possibly obsolete or maliciously subverted executables. For more information see the [Security Scorecards Documentation](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#binary-artifacts) for Binary Artifacts. **Remediation Steps** To remediate, remove the generated executable artifacts from the repository. **Artifacts Found** - third_party/jsign/jsign-4.2.jar **Additional Information** This policy is drawn from [Security Scorecards](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/), which is a tool that scores a project's adherence to security best practices. You may wish to run a Scorecards scan directly on this repository for more details. --- &lt;!-- Edit section #updates --&gt;&lt;!-- Current result text hash: e049c79475891aabde9ecbfcbc98146520ccc6b3d72d45e5d73bcca068740fdd --&gt;&lt;!-- Edit section #updates --&gt; Allstar has been installed on all Google managed GitHub orgs.

      <MESSAGE>build(devtools/build): exclude jsign.jar from the repository (#1263) According to #1250 , we are not allowed to include binaries in this repository. In this PR, I removed `./third_party/jsign/jsign-4.2.jar`, it will be downloaded during build process on demand. The workflow is: * If we are not building for Windows, nothing happens * If we are building for Windows but not signing the binaries (for example dev builds), nothing happens * If we are building and signing Windows binaries: * If `jsign-4.2.jar` already exists and matches checksum, nothing happens * otherwise, we will download it from [jsign's official GitHub releases](https://github.com/ebourg/jsign/releases)</MESSAGE>
