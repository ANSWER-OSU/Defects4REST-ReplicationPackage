  <TITLE>Feature link devices</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>It would be great to support the feature of linking devices so we can use my number. The signal-cli already supports this. So I enter on the docker container instance. `docker exec -it -u 0 NameOfContainer bash` and generate the link code `signal-cli link -n &quot;signal-laptop&quot;` It generate +- a String like this `tsdevice:/\?uuid=asdfghjkl\&amp;pub_key=qwertyuiop` Then I generate a picture (QR-Code) with https://linux.die.net/man/1/qrencode `qrencode -o linkqr.png tsdevice:/\?uuid=asdfghjkl\&amp;pub_key=qwertyuiop` Which I scan with my Android device After that, I was able to send messages via `signal-cli` from inside of the container instance. (Too good to be true.) When I call the API (`signal-cli-rest-api`) it did not work as I wanted, it gave some errors. I never tried to write in go. So I don't know if I'm going to try to do this. Also, I don't really need it. Was just playing around here. This API makes really easy to integrate other stuff. Thanks @bbernhard</DESCRIPTION>
