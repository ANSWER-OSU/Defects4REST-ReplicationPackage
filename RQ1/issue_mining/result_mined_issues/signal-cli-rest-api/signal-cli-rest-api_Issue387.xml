  <TITLE>Delete group</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### The problem I created a group with only one memeber and an empty name: `curl -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -d '{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [&quot;+123456789012&quot;]}' 'http://localhost:8080/v1/groups/+123456789012'` Now I want to delete the group. This group is not displayed in the Signal, but it is displayed on request: `curl -X GET -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; 'http://localhost:8080/v1/groups/+123456789012'` For delete the group I am executing the command in Docker terminal: `curl -X DELETE -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; 'http://localhost:8080/v1/groups/+123456789012/group.dHl...V0QT0='` or `curl -X DELETE -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; 'http://localhost:8080/v1/groups/+380978483884/dHl...V0QT0='` but groups are not removed, although I don't get an error, just an empty string in the response. I still see these groups on request: `curl -X GET -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; 'http://localhost:8080/v1/groups/+123456789012'` ### Are you using the latest released version? - [X] Yes ### Have you read the troubleshooting page? - [X] Yes ### What type of installation are you running? signal-cli-rest-api Docker Container ### In which mode are you using the docker container?
