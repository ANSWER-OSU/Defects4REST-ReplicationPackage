  <TITLE>Notifications on &quot;Note to Self&quot; stopped working</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### The problem When sending a message to self (same number on &quot;from&quot; and &quot;to&quot;), both Android and Desktop clients would trigger a standard notification. After upgrading to 0.82, that is no longer the case - the message is delivered fine, but silently, without notifications. Reverting to 0.81 restores the previous functionality. ### Are you using the latest released version? - [X] Yes ### Have you read the troubleshooting page? - [X] Yes ### What type of installation are you running? signal-cli-rest-api Docker Container ### In which mode are you using the docker container?

    <COMMIT>
      <MESSAGE>fixed bug in send method * with signal-cli 0.13.0 the default behavior changed and message to oneself did not trigger a notification anymore. As this is a behavioral change and we try to avoid any behavioral changes in the REST API, the previous behavior was reinstated again by explicitly adding &quot;--notify-self&quot;. see #511</MESSAGE>
