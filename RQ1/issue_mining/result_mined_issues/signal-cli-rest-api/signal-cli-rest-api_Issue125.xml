  <TITLE>New sample docker-compose.yml does not work</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>Hello Bernhard, I set up a complete new system since switching from a Pi to a machine with more power. Now I wanted to install your docker image again but it does not work anymore with the new docker-compose.yml file you provide. The old one is still working. Actually I don't get the point what is wrong. But I must say I don't work that often with docker. Your older example just worked out of the box. Do you have an idea whats wrong? old_code: ``` version: &quot;3&quot; services: signal-cli-rest-api: image: bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api:latest ports: - &quot;8080:8080&quot; #map docker port 8080 to host port 8080. volumes: - &quot;./signal-cli-config:/home/.local/share/signal-cli&quot; #map &quot;signal-cli-config&quot; folder on host syste... ``` new_code: ``` version: &quot;3&quot; services: signal-cli-rest-api: build: &quot;.&quot; environment: - USE_NATIVE=0 - PORT=8080 ports: - &quot;8080:8080&quot; #map docker port 8080 to host port 8080. volumes: - &quot;./signal-cli-config:/home/.local/share/signal-cli&quot; #map &quot;signal-cli-config&quot; folder on host system into docker container. the folder contains the password and cryptographic keys when a new number is registered ``` logs: ``` docker-compose -f /srv/docker/docker-compose.yml up Building signal-cli-rest-api unable to prepare context: unable to evaluate symlinks in Dockerfile path: lstat /srv/docker/Dockerfile: no such file or directory ERROR: Service 'signal-cli-rest-api' failed to build : Build failed ``` Edit: I tried now something. I just added &quot;image: bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api:latest&quot; to your code and now it works. Cheers fastboot</DESCRIPTION>
