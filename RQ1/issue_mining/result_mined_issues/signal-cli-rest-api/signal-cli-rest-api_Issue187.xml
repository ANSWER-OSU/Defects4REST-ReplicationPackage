  <TITLE>v1/groups/{phone#] API endpoint returning Go struct error</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### The problem Steps to reproduce: ``` curl -X GET -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; 'http://192.168.86.44:8080/v1/groups/+15853710007' &gt; out.json &amp;&amp; python -m json.tool out.json | less ``` And getting this response: ``` { &quot;error&quot;: &quot;json: cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field SignalCliGroupEntry.pendingMembers of type string&quot; } ``` I would expect to get the regular JSON output with the content of the groups. ### Are you using the latest released version? - [X] Yes ### Have you read the troubleshooting page? - [X] Yes ### What type of installation are you running? signal-cli-rest-api Docker Container ### In which mode are you using the docker container?
