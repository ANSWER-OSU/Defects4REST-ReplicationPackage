  <TITLE>API: send - special case for single recipients for use with limited senders</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Feature Request The `v2/send` endpoint's requirement that `recipients` be a list of strings is difficult to satisfy when calling through services that offer limited expressiveness for building a JSON object. While this isn't the API's fault, it would occasionally be really helpful if `&quot;recipients&quot;:&quot;number&quot;` were treated as being equivalent to `&quot;recipients&quot;:[&quot;number&quot;]`, or if there was an alternative `&quot;recipient&quot;:&quot;number&quot;` parameter with the same effect. I've been struggling with satisfying this endpoint lately in various notifier services: [Here](https://github.com/crazy-max/diun/issues/1005) with `diun`, although I found a workaround; [Here](https://github.com/containrrr/shoutrrr/issues/399) with shoutrrr, which maps url query params into a single level dict of strings, but can't currently express more complex JSON.</DESCRIPTION>

    <COMMIT>
      <MESSAGE>added hidden 'recipient' parameter to /v2/send endpoint * some REST API consumers (like the Synology NAS) do not allow to use an array for the recipients. So, in order to support those platforms as well, a 'recipient' string parameter is added. As most users are perfectly fine with the array parameter, the recipient parameter won't be exposed in the Swagger UI. see #428</MESSAGE>
