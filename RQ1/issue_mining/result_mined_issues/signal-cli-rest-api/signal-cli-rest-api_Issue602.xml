  <TITLE>Better documentation for endpoint /v2/send</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### The problem Going on the [swagger page](https://bbernhard.github.io/signal-cli-rest-api/#/Messages/post_v2_send) of the api, the /v2/send endpoint seems not documented with all. It would help to explain somewhere how to pass all parameters. If I'm not mistaken, they are [a lot](https://github.com/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api/blob/master/src/api/api.go). For example, I'm really not sure how to send a message to a group, mentionning someone in the message. Or what other option thant `text_mode` are available. I read the example page too and didn't find information about them. ### Are you using the latest released version? - [X] Yes ### Have you read the troubleshooting page? - [X] Yes ### What type of installation are you running? Home Assistant Signal Addon ### In which mode are you using the docker container? Normal Mode ### What's the architecture of your host system? arm64 ### Additional information _No response_</DESCRIPTION>
