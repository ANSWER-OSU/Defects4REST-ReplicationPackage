  <TITLE>Native mode - arch issue</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### The problem When using signal-cli-rest-api (via Home Assistant add-on) v0.69.0, messages can't be sent or received. Any API called result in a 400 error and the following message: ``` The current machine does not support all of the following CPU features that are required by the image: [CX8, CMOV, FXSR, MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4_1, SSE4_2, POPCNT, LZCNT, AVX, AVX2, BMI1, BMI2, FMA]. Please rebuild the executable with an appropriate setting of the -march option. ``` Appears to be related to the updated native build in the 0.69.0 release. Switching to 'normal' resolves this issue.
