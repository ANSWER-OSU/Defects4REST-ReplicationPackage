  <TITLE>Add support of extra flags for `receive` command</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>### Feature Request The `receive` endpoint now only supports the `timeout` argument, but the CLI also provides the following configs: ```text usage: signal-cli receive [-h] [-t TIMEOUT] [--max-messages MAX_MESSAGES] [--ignore-attachments] [--ignore-stories] [--send-read-receipts] named arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -t TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT Number of seconds to wait for new messages (negative values disable timeout) --max-messages MAX_MESSAGES Maximum number of messages to receive, before returning. --ignore-attachments Don’t download attachments of received messages. --ignore-stories Don’t receive story messages from the server. --send-read-receipts Send read receipts for all incoming data messages (in addition to the default delivery receipts) ``` It would be great to add support for the other flags as well. IMO `--ignore` flags are especially helpful with the auto receive feature.</DESCRIPTION>
