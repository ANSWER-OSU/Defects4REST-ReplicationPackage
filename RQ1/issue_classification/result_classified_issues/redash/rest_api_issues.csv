I believe this issue was discussed in #1238 but that lacked a proper STR to actually fix the root cause of this issue.

I have a pretty simple query with dimensions and filters, like: json { ""ids"": ""ga:177xxxxxx"", ""start_date"": ""2018-10-08"", ""end_date"": ""2018-10-12"", ""metrics"": ""ga:uniqueEvents"", ""dimensions"": ""ga:dimension1,ga:dimension3"", ""filters"": ""ga:dimension2==userrole;ga:eventCategory==eventcategory;ga:eventAction==enentaction;ga:dimension1!=demo"" }  Sometimes it returns empty result as there is no data. This results in error in redash.  Steps to Reproduce 1. Create the Google Analytics Data Source 2. Make some query returning zero rows 3.

It looks like results cache is ignoring param letters size.  Steps to Reproduce 1. Create a query with global text parameter. 2. Create dashboard with visualization for this query. 3. Open dashboard with parameter set to lowercase letter for example 'test' 4. Open dashboard on a new tab with parameter 'TEST'. In the last step you should receive visualization for parameter 'test' even when parameter value is set to 'TEST' I have been able to reproduce this scenario on demo.redash.io. To reproduce do: 1.
