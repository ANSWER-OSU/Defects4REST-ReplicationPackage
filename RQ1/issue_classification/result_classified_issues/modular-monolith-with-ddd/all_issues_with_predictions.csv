293,modular-monolith-with-ddd,https://github.com/kgrzybek/modular-monolith-with-ddd/issues/293,Remove Unused `using` Directives Following .NET 7/8 Update,"After upgrading our project to .NET 7/8, we've observed a significant number of unused using directives across our codebase. This occurrence primarily stems from the introduction of global using statements in the newer .NET versions, rendering many of the existing using statements redundant. Proposed Solution To address this, I propose an automated cleanup of these unused using directives. Utilizing the code analysis and refactoring capabilities of Rider or Visual studio, we can efficiently identify and remove these redundancies. This action is expected to impact approximately 150 files. Because of this impact it's maybe better if you (@kgrzybek) you remove it your self so you won't have to review all the changed files manually.",other-file | other-file | other-file | other-file |

But not created new record in table meetings.Members. And SendMeetingGroupCreatedEmailCommandHandler failed because it tried to find member by creator Id in Members but not MeetingGroupMembers table. And we have the same problem with SendMeetingGroupCreatedEmailCommandHandler - it failed every time it executed in infinite loop. So I think it is possible to avoid the infinite loop using try/catch and Attempts field for internal command. Also it is possible to add relations between tables in database, so it will be impossible to insert new row in table MeetingGroupMembers before inserting corresponding row in table Members BTW, why do you decide to use Guid as a primary key type instead of int?",database-file | other-file,"Accept of MeetingGroupProposal not works When meeting group proposal accepted then created MeetingGroup with MeetingGroupMember where MemberId is MeetingGroup creator Id.
