Steps to reproduce 1. Create a Form View which has both an Attachment and a Links (many-to-many) field (and some example data, of course) 2. Fill in the attachment field *first* (i.e. by picking a file from the local machine, upload it) 3. Attempt to fill in the Links field (click the plus button next to ""No records linked"", expect an autocomplete-ish drop down) 4. Error message: ""Failed to load list: something went wrong""; there is no list of records to select from (""No records match your search query""); inputs into the search field re-trigger the error above  Desired Behavior No error :), Link should be selectable (without the workaround to select it first, *then* picking a file)  Project Details Node: **v22.14.0** Arch: **x64** Platform: **linux** Docker: **true** RootDB: **pg** PackageVersion: **0.262.0**  Attachments Analysis: The Link field attempts to populate possible record values by requesting/fetching the endpoint `/api/v1/db/public/shared-view/$UUID/nested/$BASE36ISHSTRING`. It **GET**s a query which roughly decodes to: `{ limit: 10, offset: 0, fields: []`, but also, `rowData: { TheAttachmentField: [ {,""title"":""TheFilename.jpg"",""data"":""base64,/TheFullFileEncodedInBase64AAAAA`,. The size of the GET request (I think) makes it fail; even for quite small files. Chrom* reports this as `net::ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED` in the console, Firefox is rather silent on my machine. The file (contents) shouldn't be appended to the query in the first place, I guess.

Error message: ""Failed to load list: something went wrong""; there is no list of records to select from (""No records match your search query""); inputs into the search field re-trigger the error above  Desired Behavior No error :), Link should be selectable (without the workaround to select it first, *then* picking a file)  Project Details Node: **v22.14.0** Arch: **x64** Platform: **linux** Docker: **true** RootDB: **pg** PackageVersion: **0.262.0**  Attachments Analysis: The Link field attempts to populate possible record values by requesting/fetching the endpoint `/api/v1/db/public/shared-view/$UUID/nested/$BASE36ISHSTRING`. It **GET**s a query which roughly decodes to: `{ limit: 10, offset: 0, fields: []`, but also, `rowData: { TheAttachmentField: [ {,""title"":""TheFilename.jpg"",""data"":""base64,/TheFullFileEncodedInBase64AAAAA`,. The size of the GET request (I think) makes it fail; even for quite small files. Chrom* reports this as `net::ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED` in the console, Firefox is rather silent on my machine. The file (contents) shouldn't be appended to the query in the first place, I guess. As far as I can tell, this happens ultimately here: https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/blob/0cadb29e18e7f503bace209275e7148716eccd35/packages/nc-gui/composables/useLTARStore.ts#L213 ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9020300a-47b1-420c-8ad4-3cdf09a50b40) ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5595154-de08-4e85-aff9-5c4087550a92) source-file source-file source-file source-file source-file source-file source-file source-file source-file",bug,0.95

The extreme option would be a ""custom CSS rules"" box on the settings page. Regardless, I think this would be a great addition, because: 1.

The suggested change would probably be to just do: `JSON.parse(con.value)`. **Expected behavior** When the condition is met, such as when a column is true and the condition put in is `""true""`, then the webhook should be sent out afterward. I believe this is not happening because the values are not parsed from the JS side, I believe they are all literal strings instead of appropriate values. other-file other-file other-file other-file source-file source-file",bug,0.9

Not sure if these issues are sqlite-specific or apply to all databases. **Description** Creating a database with spaces within its name, or creating a column with spaces within its name, cause issues. When creating a database containing space, while the table is properly created, it can't be accessed and modified by nocodb anymore, details in the next section. When creating a column name with a space, the column value is injected within the query itself unescaped, which will fail and is a SQL injection. This is an issue for ""normal"" columns as only the first segment will be the resulting column name: `test col` will have an actual name of of `test`, while nocobd still tries to insert into `test col`. **Steps To Reproduce** 1. Create a new table `test table` 1.1. The resulting table within the database is `xa1_test table`, should likely be normalized to `test_table` 2. Attempting to save a value has an error: Attempting to access a non-existing route (404) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9059487/122080600-62d3c400-cdcc-11eb-99dd-dfbc3ec4fcd5.png) **Steps To Reproduce** 1. Create a new column `col with space` 1.1. The resulting table within the db is `xa1_col`, due to a lack of sanitization when inserting the value. 2. Attempt inserting a row 3. The insertion will fail with the message _The table X does not have a column named `col with space`_ **Steps To Reproduce** 1. Create a new column `col with space 2` 2. The insertion fails due to an invalid sql query. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9059487/122081071-c827b500-cdcc-11eb-8735-ea90690d2220.png) **Expected behavior** All of the above working. For values with spaces, I would expect an internal normalized name to be generated, with an external nice value to be mapped and used within the app. I believe this is already partially done for the view, as the tables are all underscores, but it does not work with the spaces within the column and table names.

179,nocodb,https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/issues/179,"Feature request : Import / Export file formats (CSV, JSON)","Hello ! My data is in a huge csv file (2M lines). I would like to import it into a table. Ideally it would auto-create a table, taking the column names from the first line of CSV. I would like to upload the file from my local disk, from my web browser. As a bonus, it would be nice to have flexibility on the CSV format : my file is using ""|"" as a separator rather than "","" (but I could transform my data before uploading it, so it's not a hard requirement. But it's preferable because I would like minimize the steps that I have to do in my workflow.)
