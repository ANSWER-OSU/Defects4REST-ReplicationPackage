Heres an example of how it could be structured: | NetBox Version | Python Min | Python Max | PostgreSQL Min | Redis Min | Documentation |  | 2.6 | 3.5 | 3.7 | 9.4 | - | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/7fc60cd667d07ed5a43288f3eac5f67c1962d9e8/docs/installation/index.md) | | 2.7 | 3.5 | 3.7 | 9.4 | - | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/ea91e09a1b76c1d389270734141623157827ab5f/docs/installation/index.md) | | 2.8 | **3.6** | **3.8** | **9.5** | **3.4** | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/d79ed76d80835798e47c8eead6fbfc75450b6cef/docs/installation/index.md) | | 2.9 | 3.6 | 3.8 | 9.5 | **4.0** | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/7b05a1817345881239f9a7337b0b8b6ad8cf56a4/docs/installation/index.md) | | 2.10 | 3.6 | 3.8 | **9.6** | 4.0 | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/91ea12344c73797fdd9767fd518b842c3efdb62e/docs/installation/index.md) | | 2.11 | 3.6 | **3.9** | 9.6 | 4.0 | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/f26227ecec9a5a92333f4c9f48bdd4d371b0b2f2/docs/installation/index.md) | | 3.0 | **3.7** | 3.9 | 9.6 | 4.0 | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/fd16c47d2e1d9b3b4a0a9e39de4f3dea759fb250/docs/installation/index.md) | | 3.1 | 3.7 | 3.9 | **10** | 4.0 | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/5a59f2352c39e7040dd4537e5225d609cb14ffc1/docs/installation/index.md) | | 3.2 | **3.8** | **3.10** | 10 | 4.0 | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/d4938b7699115491fdaf3ddf0e830f6120c3ed60/docs/installation/index.md) | | 3.3 | 3.8 | 3.10 | 10 | 4.0 | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/306e98a81ed80ce17b993269fc8d0da9855d8339/docs/installation/index.md) | | 3.4 | 3.8 | 3.10 | **11** | 4.0 | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/def3ccfaee34fb0376efc50f935129c416998d95/docs/installation/index.md) | | 3.5 | 3.8 | 3.10 | 11 | 4.0 | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/eac7d01977d7c23768f651904bbab50d271d10d9/docs/installation/index.md) | | 3.6 | 3.8 | **3.11** | **12** | 4.0 | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/dfcfbe240ddf6f73a61ab857912115afbf78664d/docs/installation/index.md) | | 3.7 | 3.8 | 3.11 | 12 | 4.0 | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/7b90481fc9bc7cf30da5b2027877a2d5cb63a919/docs/installation/index.md) | | 4.0 | **3.10** | **3.12** | 12 | 4.0 | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/91f156de33c557cda3dc3969b5dbb15228a0a776/docs/installation/index.md) | | 4.1 | 3.10 | 3.12 | 12 | 4.0 | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/7bc0d34196323ac992d7ec80b1caa48e6094d88d/docs/installation/index.md) | | 4.2 | 3.10 | 3.12 | **13** | 4.0 | [Link](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/9d82a668a4a8a2762d8f1f6a9754234a99888313/docs/installation/index.md) | Would love to hear your thoughts on this!

FIELD_CHOICES (in configuration.py) have been in use for a long time to define custom status values for racks, devices, circuits, and prefixes. 2. Perform an upgrade following the steps from the documentation: sudo git fetch --tags sudo git checkout v4.3.0-beta1 sudo ./upgrade.sh 3. The upgrade cannot proceed due to errors, which are described below in the Observed Behavior section. NOTICE: When the same upgrade steps are performed without any use of FIELD_CHOICES, the upgrade completes without issues.  Expected Behavior Upgrade should complete successfully or at least provide clear migration guidance for deprecated or removed constants like FIELD_CHOICES.

19225,netbox,https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/19225,GraphQL filter functionality missing in v4.3.0-beta1," Deployment Type Self-hosted  NetBox Version v4.3.0-beta1  Python Version 3.12  Steps to Reproduce 1. Attempt to write a GraphQL query to filter `circuit_list` by 1 or more sites. Or filter an `ip_address_list` by the device or VM they belong to.  Expected Behavior Filters exist to filter circuits by the site one of their terminations belongs to, filters exist to filter IP addresses based on the device or virtual machine they're attached to. Example query for circuits based on site entries that works pre-4.2: graphql query siteCircuits($sites: [String!]) { circuit_list(filters: {site: $sites}) { id cid provider { name } termination_z { termination {  on SiteType { id name } } } } }  The `$sites` variable is:  { ""sites"": [ ""dm-albany"", ""dm-rochester"" ] }   Observed Behavior No filters exist to do this on IPAddress or Circuit filter options in GraphQL in 4.3-beta1. For circuits, the closest I can get is 'reversing' the query and querying circuit terminations instead. graphql query MyQuery { circuit_termination_list( filters: {termination_type: {app_label: {exact: ""dcim""}, model: {exact: ""site""}}, termination_id: ""7""} ) { termination {  on SiteType { id name } } term_side circuit { cid commit_rate install_date id provider { id name } provider_account { account id name } } } }  However: this requires the NetBox ID of the site to be known (instead of being able to use the slug today), and the only way to filter on multiple related-object IDs is to do a verbose ""OR"" operator instead of being able to do `termination_id: {in_list: [1, 2, 3, 4]}` (for circuit terminations, not circuits). In the case of IP Addresses you can't even do a filter such as `assigned_object_id: {in_list: [1, 2, 3, 4]}` (for IP Addresses) using multiple interface IDs from a single device. As has always been the case since GraphQL was introduced, you could write a more ""indirect"" query starting with the device_list, and adding interfaces for the device, and each interface's IP Addresses nested within, but this is a significant change from previous behavior and also limits the flexibility & functionality of the GraphQL API. There maybe be other GraphQL objects that are impacted, these are just the two most immediate cases that I've uncovered. Not being able to filter by multiple IDs (even using standard GraphQL syntax of ""`some_object_id: {in_list: [1, 2, 3, 4]}`"") is a big hindrance, but being able to filter by indirect relationships is very valuable and is how the NetBox GraphQL API has worked for quite a while now.",source-file | source-file | source-file | source-file | source-file | source-file | source-file | source-file | source-file,"GraphQL filter functionality missing in v4.3.0-beta1  Deployment Type Self-hosted  NetBox Version v4.3.0-beta1  Python Version 3.12  Steps to Reproduce 1.

Each instance of this model will define a user-configurable schema of attributes to be assigned on module types having this profile. python class ModuleTypeProfile(NetBoxModel): name = models.CharField() schema = models.JSONField()  The `schema` field will hold a user-defined [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) which defines the scalar attributes that can be defined on module types with this profile. For example, a CPU profile might have a profile specify the following: json { ""properties"": { ""architecture"": { ""type"": ""string"" }, ""speed"": { ""type"": ""number"", ""minimum"": ""0.01"", ""multipleOf"": ""0.01"" }, ""cores"": { ""type"": ""number"", ""minimum"": 1, ""multipleOf"": 1 } } }  Note that these attributes are intentionally limited to storing the [basic types](https://cswr.github.io/JsonSchema/spec/basic_types/) supported by JSON schema (strings, numbers, booleans, and null). Any more advanced needs will require the use of a custom field on the ModuleType model.  ModuleType Two new fields will be added to the ModuleType model: * `profile`: An optional ForeignKey to ModuleTypeProfile * `attributes`: A JSONField which stores the assigned key-value pairs for a module type as defined by the assigned profile When editing a module type, the UI form will be extended to render all profile attributes as discrete form fields, with simple validation applied automatically.  Use case The introduction of module type profiles with configurable attributes will improve the ability to accurately model field-replaceable units (FRU) as modules in NetBox. Today, this is typically done using inventory items, however that model is considerably limited in several ways: * Inventory items have no ability to track unoccupied bays/sockets * Inventory items (like other device components) must be named * Inventory items cannot contain components (interfaces, power ports, etc.) * There is no mechanism available for storing profile-specific attributes on inventory items Modules are better suited for this task, as only the last constraint listed above affects modules as well, and is overcome by the changes proposed in this FR.

18434,netbox,https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/18434,Add SPB in L2VPN," NetBox version v4.2.2  Feature type Data model extension  Proposed functionality This feature request proposes adding support for **Shortest Path Bridging (SPB)** as an option in NetBox's `L2VPNTypeChoices`. These addition aim to enhance NetBoxs ability to model and document SPB networks effectively.  Specific Changes: 1. **L2VPNTypeChoices**: - Add `TYPE_SPB` with a user-facing label of ""SPB."" - Update the `CHOICES` tuple to include a new category or entry for SPB. 2. **Workflows and Data Models**: - This change would expand the selection of supported protocols in `L2VPNTypeChoices`. - They would not alter existing workflows but offer more options for documenting and managing network infrastructures. 4. **User Interface**: - These new options would be visible in any form or interface where the `L2VPNTypeChoices` is used. ![L2VPNType Choices](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2992ff24-86a7-43c8-a14c-0aab3eeacfd9) **Note:** I am ready to submit a pull request with the proposed modifications. My commit is already available here: [https://github.com/Mathias-gt/netbox/commit/ecc679ad1e86cc5466352528a0c5f6054e13f2a5](https://github.com/Mathias-gt/netbox/commit/ecc679ad1e86cc5466352528a0c5f6054e13f2a5).   Use case Adding support for SPB addresses the need for modern networks to document and manage increasingly diverse protocols. This protocol is widely deployed in enterprise networks for its scalability, flexibility, and simplicity.  Benefits: - **SPB**: Enables users to document deployments of Shortest Path Bridging, used for simplifying and scaling Layer 2 networks. Supporting this L2VPN type ensures that NetBox can serve as a comprehensive source of truth for organizations using this protocol.   Database changes No changes to the database schema are required.

These addition aim to enhance NetBoxs ability to model and document SPB networks effectively.  Specific Changes: 1. **L2VPNTypeChoices**: - Add `TYPE_SPB` with a user-facing label of ""SPB."" - Update the `CHOICES` tuple to include a new category or entry for SPB. 2. **Workflows and Data Models**: - This change would expand the selection of supported protocols in `L2VPNTypeChoices`. - They would not alter existing workflows but offer more options for documenting and managing network infrastructures. 4. **User Interface**: - These new options would be visible in any form or interface where the `L2VPNTypeChoices` is used. ![L2VPNType Choices](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2992ff24-86a7-43c8-a14c-0aab3eeacfd9) **Note:** I am ready to submit a pull request with the proposed modifications. My commit is already available here: [https://github.com/Mathias-gt/netbox/commit/ecc679ad1e86cc5466352528a0c5f6054e13f2a5](https://github.com/Mathias-gt/netbox/commit/ecc679ad1e86cc5466352528a0c5f6054e13f2a5).   Use case Adding support for SPB addresses the need for modern networks to document and manage increasingly diverse protocols. This protocol is widely deployed in enterprise networks for its scalability, flexibility, and simplicity.  Benefits: - **SPB**: Enables users to document deployments of Shortest Path Bridging, used for simplifying and scaling Layer 2 networks. Supporting this L2VPN type ensures that NetBox can serve as a comprehensive source of truth for organizations using this protocol.   Database changes No changes to the database schema are required. The proposed functionality involves extending the existing `L2VPNTypeChoices`. These changes will only add new constants and options to existing enumerations, leveraging the current model structure.  External dependencies No new external dependencies are introduced by this feature. The proposed changes only extend existing functionality within NetBox's existing framework. source-file",no-bug,0.95

18403,netbox,https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/18403,Improve performance of Job queries," NetBox version v4.2.1  Feature type Change to existing functionality  Triage priority I volunteer to perform this work (if approved)  Proposed functionality If the output of a script(s) is relatively large (see MOP below) and the script has been run multiple times (see MOP below) the UI struggles to retrieve the completed script-related jobs efficiently (or sometimes at all) and out-of-memory exceptions are prevalent. The proposed FR here is to optimize the queries for Jobs by not retrieving the `data` field unless it is needed. The `data` field cannot be displayed in the list table and is not needed for the delete form or even the housekeeping task. So omitting the `data` field will improve performance while retaining existing functionality. Here is a MOP and illustration to replicate the underlying issue: 1. Create a fresh install of NetBox with no database objects. 2. Add a script that is capable of generating a large `output`, such as:  from extras.scripts import Script, IntegerVar class GenerateTestString(Script): class Meta: name = 'Generate test string' description = 'A test script used to generate a string output of the given length' scheduling_enabled = True # Fields length = IntegerVar( label = 'Text Length', description = 'Enter the length of the string generated.', min_value = 1, max_value = 1000000000, ) def run(self, data, commit): return '0' * data['length']  3. Run the script roughly 60 times (either manually or by scheduling it) with the `length` field set to 100,000,000 which will generate an output string of 100m characters. 4. Test the performance of the Job list view and attempt to bulk delete the Jobs. Here's an illustration using the above MOP and the results: ![netbox_job_performance](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd1c01a5-e56c-4a17-9238-d3b45aadac37) The fix would likely be using the `defer()` method as `Job.objects.defer('data')` rather than the `only()` method listing the included fields shown in the illustration. I also believe these large jobs can hinder the completion of the housekeeping task that purges the jobs, allowing the job count to grow without limit.  Use case Our environment uses a few scheduled scripts to provide data output to API integrations that combine models (such as Devices and Virtual Machines) and that traverse relationships (such as Prefixes and their associated IP Ranges and IP Addresses and their associated Interfaces and MAC Addresses). The output of these scripts is inherently larger than typical script use cases. Granted the GraphQL API exists to solve for this use case to some extent, the script output provides a very customizable output and there are other open issues related to the functionality and performance of the GraphQL API.
