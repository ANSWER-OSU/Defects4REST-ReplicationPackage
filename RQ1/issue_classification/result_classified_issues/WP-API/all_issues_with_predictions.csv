571,WP-API,https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues/571,Core Merging Plan for the API,"The key to getting the API into core is breaking the merge into steps. I've been talking these through with the rest of the team at WCSF, and we're going to break this up into a few basic steps. Each of these steps has challenges, but the idea is to try and handle these step-by-step to chip away at the larger task. At the end of each step, we'll stop and make sure we've completed everything we wanted to, ensure we have nothing else to do, then shepherd it into core. The next step doesn't start until the previous is fully complete. The actual process of finalising each step will be to separate the relevant code into a separate repository, then formatting it as a core patch. These can then be reviewed separately, and merged into WP core at the behest of the core team. (The actual timing for this depends on the release cycles and such, but this doesn't need to affect our work.)  Step 0: Reinvigorate the two-dot-oh branch  Step 1: Pushing ahead with infrastructure  Step 2: Making our core objects available * YOU ARE HERE Step 3: Periphery .  ## Step 0: Reinvigorate the two-dot-oh branch We've decided internally that the resource approach taken on `two-dot-oh` isn't going to work. In short, the benefits we imagined didn't really turn up, however we did learn some about our approach here. We'll handle that in a later step.

I've been talking these through with the rest of the team at WCSF, and we're going to break this up into a few basic steps. Each of these steps has challenges, but the idea is to try and handle these step-by-step to chip away at the larger task. At the end of each step, we'll stop and make sure we've completed everything we wanted to, ensure we have nothing else to do, then shepherd it into core. The next step doesn't start until the previous is fully complete. The actual process of finalising each step will be to separate the relevant code into a separate repository, then formatting it as a core patch. These can then be reviewed separately, and merged into WP core at the behest of the core team. (The actual timing for this depends on the release cycles and such, but this doesn't need to affect our work.)

In order for a featured image to be set, the media has to be created. Then the post has to be created. Then the post has to be updated `public function attach_thumbnail( $post, $data, $update ) {if ( ! $update ) {return;} ` This, in my opinion, is inefficient and requires a remote device to make three requests to the server instead of just on or two. The - is $update - conditional should be removed? On this same note, in order for a remote device to update meta data, the device has to call the post/post-type meta get request, then parse the available meta to obtain meta ID's and then send that data back in the form of an automatically indexed array. One, the meta ID is not readily available in wordpress. So, a devloper cannot readily provide the device developer with appropriate meta key values to use for creation/updating. I understand that accessing the meta via get request allows for all use cases, but using the id as the determining get/set value is obscure as far as typical wordpress goes. Two, because the array is expected to be automatically indexed, each index consisting of an associative array with keys ID, Key, and Value, if a developer needs to hook into the create/edit post to deal with meta in a specific way (such as arrays, objects or serialized data), they then have to loop through all meta and ""look"" for a key (or an ID, but no one will be looking for meta id, they will be using keys) manually. This is time consuming. The array, in my opinion, should look more like `$data['post_meta'] = array(""key1""=>""val1"", ""key2"" => ""val2"", )` instead of `$data['post_meta'] = array( array(""ID""=>""id1"",""Key""=>""key1"", ""Value""=>""val1), array(""ID""=>""id2"",""Key""=>""key2"", ""Value""=>""val2), );` It makes it easier to deal with just the value you want to deal with, instead of having to loop through the entire stack (or even up to found point with break).

338,WP-API,https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues/338,Better solution for wp meta enpoints,"Currently, post meta is accessed via an array of ambiguous arrays each containing the keys id, key and value. I believe the current solution has been made overly complex and can be simplified significantly. There are four main requests for meta just as there are those for posts; get, post, put, delete. The problem of distinguishing between those using post parameters is unnecessary. Each has it's own endpoint method. There is no need in complicating it. Now, the issue of distinguishing what type of meta value the user is attempting to place is not so difficult either. Yes, the data can be an array, a single value, or a single value associated with a key that has multiple values. Working with the specific meta id is one way of doing it, yes, but it is an obscure way of doing it because the WP api does not, as a general rule, work with the meta id's directly. Getting meta should be gathered through the method associated with the get request. Format would be output of the call request params. UR params would be (for single key with posts/{ID}/meta/{KEY}/ &single=true :: this may be unnecessary because data will be returned as serialzed string anyway &custom=true :: get_post_custom_values($key, $post_id); Creating the meta would be a call to posts/{ID}/meta and would accept the data params unique=true single=true :: where single false is a text value and single true is data that is to be treated as an array, if object for any reason, cast into array, then placed into add_post_meta. Array will be serialized automatically. There may be complexities with the variety of forms data will be received, but the data is placed into the value fields as a serialized string, so then parsing the data to json should not be too problematic. key = ""blah blah"" value = ""blah blah"" or json {blah blah} Putting (or updating) the meta would be a call to posts/{id}/meta/{KEY} and would accept the data paras value = ""blah blah"" or json {blah blah} previous_value = ""blah blah"" or json {blah blah} Using update_post_meta. Despite the fact that there may be a key out there somewhere that has more than one entry with identical values, update_post_meta by default says this: ""This function will update only the first field that matches the criteria."" So, going out of the way to update only specific id values is beyond what the majority of devs will do locally, notwithstanding the REST API. If they want a key with multiple values, the majority of devs will not use the same key, but rather use an array. The only benefit to using the same key with multiple values would be for searching by meta anyway. I believe that typically, the majority of devs find other ways of dealing with this. Despite that, however, the logic in the above is that if you have one key with multiple duplicate values, you only need to update one and it does not matter what its ID is in the database. The same key will still hold the various values, the id's are pretty irrelevant in this case and are not needed in the API. Deleting the meta would be a call to posts/{id}/meta/{KEY} and would accept the data and url params could be: &previous_value = ""blah blah"" or json {blah blah} Deletion would be the only problem I find in using standard WP methods. This is because some serialized data may be very long. However, this can simply fall on the shoulders of the dev who, when creating meta, should not have serialized data in keys that are not unique. If this is practiced (and it is a good practice), then the delete request can be passed empty, which will omit the third parameter of delete_post_meta causing the key, in it's entirety to be removed. This is how I would suggest dealing with meta. It follows all the rules of REST, all the standard API usages of WP, and makes life easier for all involved when dealing with meta.",other-file,"Better solution for wp meta enpoints Currently, post meta is accessed via an array of ambiguous arrays each containing the keys id, key and value.

UR params would be (for single key with posts/{ID}/meta/{KEY}/ &single=true :: this may be unnecessary because data will be returned as serialzed string anyway &custom=true :: get_post_custom_values($key, $post_id); Creating the meta would be a call to posts/{ID}/meta and would accept the data params unique=true single=true :: where single false is a text value and single true is data that is to be treated as an array, if object for any reason, cast into array, then placed into add_post_meta. Array will be serialized automatically. There may be complexities with the variety of forms data will be received, but the data is placed into the value fields as a serialized string, so then parsing the data to json should not be too problematic. key = ""blah blah"" value = ""blah blah"" or json {blah blah} Putting (or updating) the meta would be a call to posts/{id}/meta/{KEY} and would accept the data paras value = ""blah blah"" or json {blah blah} previous_value = ""blah blah"" or json {blah blah} Using update_post_meta. Despite the fact that there may be a key out there somewhere that has more than one entry with identical values, update_post_meta by default says this: ""This function will update only the first field that matches the criteria."" So, going out of the way to update only specific id values is beyond what the majority of devs will do locally, notwithstanding the REST API. If they want a key with multiple values, the majority of devs will not use the same key, but rather use an array. The only benefit to using the same key with multiple values would be for searching by meta anyway. I believe that typically, the majority of devs find other ways of dealing with this. Despite that, however, the logic in the above is that if you have one key with multiple duplicate values, you only need to update one and it does not matter what its ID is in the database. The same key will still hold the various values, the id's are pretty irrelevant in this case and are not needed in the API. Deleting the meta would be a call to posts/{id}/meta/{KEY} and would accept the data and url params could be: &previous_value = ""blah blah"" or json {blah blah} Deletion would be the only problem I find in using standard WP methods. This is because some serialized data may be very long. However, this can simply fall on the shoulders of the dev who, when creating meta, should not have serialized data in keys that are not unique. If this is practiced (and it is a good practice), then the delete request can be passed empty, which will omit the third parameter of delete_post_meta causing the key, in it's entirety to be removed. This is how I would suggest dealing with meta. It follows all the rules of REST, all the standard API usages of WP, and makes life easier for all involved when dealing with meta. other-file",no-bug,0.9

So in our filter for `rest_url` we have to sniff out if a path has a leading slash or not - not the end of the world, but it might be nice to have a consistent standard in the core endpoints when calling `rest_url()` for links. other-file other-file other-file other-file other-file other-file other-file test-file test-file test-file test-file other-file other-file other-file other-file other-file other-file other-file test-file test-file test-file test-file",no-bug,0.8
