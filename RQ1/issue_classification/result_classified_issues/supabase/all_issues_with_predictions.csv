Which is just the 404 page. If I look at the network requests, it seems to be making a request to  http://localhost:8000/project/default/undefined/projects/default/types/typescript  which looks like a pretty broken URL. ## To Reproduce 1. Set up a self-hosted instance with docker 2. Open up the studio 3. Click the ""generate types"" button 4. See error ## Expected behavior I expect it to download the typescript definitions. ## System information - OS: Debian Linux - Browser: Chrome - Version of supabase-js: N/A - Version of Node.js: N/A ## Additional context I'm also completely unable to generate these types through the CLI. This essentially makes Supabase unusable for me.

21645,supabase,https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/21645,"supabase_imgproxy ""Source image resolution is too big"" when images >= 16.8MP in local dev / self-hosted","# Bug report - [X] I confirm this is a bug with Supabase, not with my own application. - [X] I confirm I have searched the [Docs](https://docs.supabase.com), GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions), and [Discord](https://discord.supabase.com). ## Describe the bug [Storage Image Transformations  Limits](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/serving/image-transformations#limits) states: ""The image resolution cannot exceed 50MP."" However, `docker-compose.yml` does not set the required value `IMGPROXY_MAX_SRC_RESOLUTION` to increase the default value of 16.8MP to 50MP for local development / self-hosted contexts. As a result, my local dev / self hosted experience differs in an undocumented way from production, and there doesn't seem to be an easy way to adjust this setting locally. The way it manifests locally is also a bit confusing/unclear because (at least for me in the context of building a Next.js app), the first way it manifests is as a 404 error when requesting an image transform URL for an image that is >= 16.8 MP.

If you are looking for help, please try these first: - Docs: https://docs.supabase.com - Discussions: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions - Discord: https://discord.supabase.com Before opening a bug report, please verify the following: --> - [X] I confirm this is a bug with Supabase, not with my own application. - [X] I confirm I have searched the [Docs](https://docs.supabase.com), GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions). ## Describe the bug A clear and concise description of what the bug is. I have a table with an int4[] (integer array) column set to `NOT NULL` and a default of `'{}'::integer[]` In the table editor if I go to edit an existing entry of `[0, 1]` it appears in the input as `[0, 1]` as expected. If I edit an existing entry of `[]` it appears in the input as `[]` as expected. If I edit an exisiting entry of `[1]` it appears just as `1` and If I wanted to say swap it to `0` I have to add `[ ]` around it myself or it errors. Setting it to just `1` works and results in `[1]` This happens with other singular numbers e.g. `[3]` ## To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository: 1. Create a table with an integer array not null with default empty array 2. Create a row with multiple numbers 3. Edit and see it works fine, set the list to just 0 4. go to edit again and see just the number no square brackets 5. go to save and get an error 6. add the square brackets yourself and save successfully ## Expected behavior A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. Input should have square brackets ## Screenshots If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62055cba-1a30-4ec3-a366-f57b905cf64c) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53f9f208-8e33-419f-a29e-be98bb88aab2) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24214e55-ec67-443d-9e13-5c5729fd5f53) ## System information - OS: Linux - Browser: Firefox",other-file | other-file,"Local web ui - table editor - Editing an int4 column in the db with one item has no square brackets # Bug report <!--  We receive a lot of bug reports which have already been solved or discussed.
