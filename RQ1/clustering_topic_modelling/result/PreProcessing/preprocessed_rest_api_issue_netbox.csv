19225,netbox,https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/19225,GraphQL filter functionality missing in v4.3.0-beta1," Deployment Type Self-hosted  NetBox Version v4.3.0-beta1  Python Version 3.12  Steps to Reproduce 1. Attempt to write a GraphQL query to filter `circuit_list` by 1 or more sites. Or filter an `ip_address_list` by the device or VM they belong to.  Expected Behavior Filters exist to filter circuits by the site one of their terminations belongs to, filters exist to filter IP addresses based on the device or virtual machine they're attached to. Example query for circuits based on site entries that works pre-4.2: graphql query siteCircuits($sites: [String!]) { circuit_list(filters: {site: $sites}) { id cid provider { name } termination_z { termination {  on SiteType { id name } } } } }  The `$sites` variable is:  { ""sites"": [ ""dm-albany"", ""dm-rochester"" ] }   Observed Behavior No filters exist to do this on IPAddress or Circuit filter options in GraphQL in 4.3-beta1. For circuits, the closest I can get is 'reversing' the query and querying circuit terminations instead. graphql query MyQuery { circuit_termination_list( filters: {termination_type: {app_label: {exact: ""dcim""}, model: {exact: ""site""}}, termination_id: ""7""} ) { termination {  on SiteType { id name } } term_side circuit { cid commit_rate install_date id provider { id name } provider_account { account id name } } } }  However: this requires the NetBox ID of the site to be known (instead of being able to use the slug today), and the only way to filter on multiple related-object IDs is to do a verbose ""OR"" operator instead of being able to do `termination_id: {in_list: [1, 2, 3, 4]}` (for circuit terminations, not circuits). In the case of IP Addresses you can't even do a filter such as `assigned_object_id: {in_list: [1, 2, 3, 4]}` (for IP Addresses) using multiple interface IDs from a single device. As has always been the case since GraphQL was introduced, you could write a more ""indirect"" query starting with the device_list, and adding interfaces for the device, and each interface's IP Addresses nested within, but this is a significant change from previous behavior and also limits the flexibility & functionality of the GraphQL API. There maybe be other GraphQL objects that are impacted, these are just the two most immediate cases that I've uncovered. Not being able to filter by multiple IDs (even using standard GraphQL syntax of ""`some_object_id: {in_list: [1, 2, 3, 4]}`"") is a big hindrance, but being able to filter by indirect relationships is very valuable and is how the NetBox GraphQL API has worked for quite a while now.",source-file | source-file | source-file | source-file | source-file | source-file | source-file | source-file | source-file,graphql filter functionality missing beta deployment type self hosted beta python steps reproduce attempt write graphql query filter circuit list sites filter address list device belong expected behavior filters exist filter circuits site one terminations belongs filters exist filter addresses based device virtual machine attached example query circuits based site entries works pre graphql query sitecircuits sites string circuit list filters site sites cid provider name termination termination sitetype name sites variable sites albany rochester observed behavior filters exist ipaddress circuit filter options graphql beta circuits closest get reversing query querying circuit terminations instead graphql query myquery circuit termination list filters termination type app label exact dcim model exact site termination termination sitetype name term side circuit cid rate install date provider name provider account account name however requires site known instead able use slug today way filter multiple related object ids verbose operator instead able termination list circuit terminations circuits case addresses even filter assigned object list addresses multiple interface ids single device always case since graphql introduced could write indirect query starting device list adding interfaces device interface addresses nested within significant previous behavior also limits flexibility functionality graphql api maybe graphql objects impacted two immediate cases uncovered able filter multiple ids even standard graphql syntax object list big hindrance able filter indirect relationships valuable graphql api worked quite,bug,0.9,"GraphQL filter functionality missing in v4.3.0-beta1  Deployment Type Self-hosted  NetBox Version v4.3.0-beta1  Python Version 3.12  Steps to Reproduce 1. Attempt to write a GraphQL query to filter `circuit_list` by 1 or more sites. Or filter an `ip_address_list` by the device or VM they belong to.  Expected Behavior Filters exist to filter circuits by the site one of their terminations belongs to, filters exist to filter IP addresses based on the device or virtual machine they're attached to. Example query for circuits based on site entries that works pre-4.2: graphql query siteCircuits($sites: [String!]) { circuit_list(filters: {site: $sites}) { id cid provider { name } termination_z { termination {  on SiteType { id name } } } } }  The `$sites` variable is:  { ""sites"": [ ""dm-albany"", ""dm-rochester"" ] }   Observed Behavior No filters exist to do this on IPAddress or Circuit filter options in GraphQL in 4.3-beta1. For circuits, the closest I can get is 'reversing' the query and querying circuit terminations instead. graphql query MyQuery { circuit_termination_list( filters: {termination_type: {app_label: {exact: ""dcim""}, model: {exact: ""site""}}, termination_id: ""7""} ) { termination {  on SiteType { id name } } term_side circuit { cid commit_rate install_date id provider { id name } provider_account { account id name } } } }  However: this requires the NetBox ID of the site to be known (instead of being able to use the slug today), and the only way to filter on multiple related-object IDs is to do a verbose ""OR"" operator instead of being able to do `termination_id: {in_list: [1, 2, 3, 4]}` (for circuit terminations, not circuits). In the case of IP Addresses you can't even do a filter such as `assigned_object_id: {in_list: [1, 2, 3, 4]}` (for IP Addresses) using multiple interface IDs from a single device. As has always been the case since GraphQL was introduced, you could write a more ""indirect"" query starting with the device_list, and adding interfaces for the device, and each interface's IP Addresses nested within, but this is a significant change from previous behavior and also limits the flexibility & functionality of the GraphQL API. There maybe be other GraphQL objects that are impacted, these are just the two most immediate cases that I've uncovered. Not being able to filter by multiple IDs (even using standard GraphQL syntax of ""`some_object_id: {in_list: [1, 2, 3, 4]}`"") is a big hindrance, but being able to filter by indirect relationships is very valuable and is how the NetBox GraphQL API has worked for quite a while now."
