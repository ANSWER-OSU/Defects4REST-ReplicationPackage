13,zuul,https://github.com/Netflix/zuul/issues/13,Change the default response code,"For requests processed by Zuul, the default response code is 200. Returning a 200 has the potential to mask issues with routing filter changes. Making the default response status a 500 will allow for finding issues earlier. When a request is proxied to a backend, the status code for the proxy action is set by Zuul based on the response from the backend. However if the filter is not a static response filter and the response never enters the route/proxy filter process an empty response is sent out by zuul with a 200. Changes need to be made to prevent it from happening.",other-file | source-file | source-file,default response requests processed default response returning potential mask issues routing filter changes making default response status allow finding issues earlier proxied backend status proxy action set based response backend however filter static response filter response never enters route proxy filter process empty response sent changes need made prevent happening,bug,0.9,"Change the default response code For requests processed by Zuul, the default response code is 200.
