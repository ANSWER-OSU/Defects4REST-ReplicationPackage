15291,Ghost,https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/15291,Regression: Redirect to signin/re-authenticate modal not shown when logged out,"We've had a regression with how unauthenticated requests are handled by Admin. Unauthenticated requests could occur if you've logged out in another tab and didn't realise you'd gone back to editing on a tab that looked like it was still logged in. ## Steps to reproduce 1. Open Ghost admin and ensure you're logged in in two different tabs 2. In tab 1, open the editor 3. In tab 2, logout 4. In tab 1, attempt to save ## Previous behaviour - whilst editing - show a re-authentication modal to allow quick sign-in and save - whilst performing any other action - redirect to signin screen ## Current behaviour: - all actions - show a slightly cryptic alert message `Authorization failed Unable to determine the authenticated user or integration. Check that cookies are being passed through if using session authentication.` This is likely happening because we've moved from a `401` to a `403`. The cookie is being sent so the request is not ""Unauthenticated"" but it no longer matches a valid session so its ""Unauthorized"". Admin isn't currently set up to recognise a 403 and trigger the auto-logout/re-authenticate behaviour. There are potential edge cases if we treat 403 and 401 the same when it's a genuine ""not permitted"" error but Admin shouldn't be making any such requests unless your role is changed by another user whilst you're using it. Note: There is a skipped test for the re-authentication modal here: https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/0695f74a653bff85d5a08ee7f97fc9a4a8ddbe63/ghost/admin/tests/acceptance/authentication-test.js#L97 which may have contributed to this regression slipping in.

16748,Ghost,https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/16748,admin/members/:id/signin_url won't take Owner's staff access token," Issue Summary I'm trying to make a fetch request to admin/members/:id/signin_url The [commit](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/commit/b0ff1e7cacf619deed1d4f07c3cb0e7731707597) (Hi @naz !) that added the functionality seems to suggest this is possible. I'm converting the owner's staff access token into a JWT successfully, based on it working elsewhere on the admin API. I've tried on Ghost Pro (but it was a site where I'd switched owners, so could be an edge case). I've also tried on a production 5.13 self-hosted site, and on a 5.47 local install (Windows). Here's what I'm getting back (fresh 5.47 install, but all cases are the same): Request to: http://localhost:2368/ghost/api/canary/admin/members/6456ef85849b402bb40c61f4/signin_urls/  errors: [ { message: 'Permission error, cannot read member_signin_url.', context: 'You do not have permission to read member_signin_urls', type: 'NoPermissionError', details: null, property: null, help: null, code: null, id: '714c58e0-ec6e-11ed-94c9-6ba7df6bb971', ghostErrorCode: null } ]  The endpoint works fine if I pass in the site owner's cookie.

But this specific returns an error: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f-JlzBuUUU`. ![CleanShot 2022-12-25 at 20 10 24@2x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1881676/209479558-2388988d-e2db-4116-b7bb-0b56eef57e1f.jpg) The request is the following:  https://cassandradispatch.org/ghost/api/admin/oembed/?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f-JlzBuUUU&type=embed  The error response is the following: json { ""errors"": [ { ""message"": ""Internal server error, cannot read oembed."", ""context"": ""invalid json response body at https://www.youtube.com/oembed?format=json&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5f-JlzBuUUU reason: Unexpected token U in JSON at position 0"", ""type"": ""InternalServerError"", ""details"": null, ""property"": null, ""help"": null, ""code"": null, ""id"": ""e01223d0-8487-11ed-94c3-8df7a8a46270"", ""ghostErrorCode"": null } ] }  This is becaue the request `https://www.youtube.com/oembed?format=json&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5f-JlzBuUUU` Returns `Unauthorized` as the response body.

Example of my [website](https://www.benjaminrancourt.ca/sitemap.xml), where I've disabled the `authors` taxonomy. html <tr> <td> <a href=""https://www.benjaminrancourt.ca/sitemap-authors.xml""> https://www.benjaminrancourt.ca/sitemap-authors.xml </a> </td> <td>1970-01-01 00:00</td> </tr>  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7907713/174452395-01298c43-b958-4844-9d08-e4daeb9bff8e.png) > The sitemap can be read, but it contains errors | Empty sitemap ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7907713/174452417-ff20bcd4-ea8a-41cd-8fa3-3c7af6fcca02.png)  I tried to find a way to fix this in Ghost source code, but I couldn't run a working setup on my machine (I really should install Linux ).
