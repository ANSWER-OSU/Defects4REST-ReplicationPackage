556,Annif,https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/issues/556,vocabulary in SKOS (Turtle serialization) should be loaded even in case of lacking language tags,"Hi! I've noticed some potentially inconsistent behaviour of the annif loadvoc command when loading voacabulary in ttl SKOS without language tags. We've currently switched in our project from simple tsv vocabulary format to SKOS. I assumed that since we do not provide any information about language in tsv file, we don't necessarily have to add appropriate language tags in SKOS either. But it turned out, that loading vocabulary in SKOS without language tags prevents annif from creating the subject index (though original ttl file is being copied and gzipped file is being dumped). It seems, that when annif converts tsv to SKOS, it adds language tags (they're based upon language configuration in projects.cfg), but when it loads vocabulary directly from SKOS format, it checks if language tag for a label is the same as language code in projects.cfg, and when it's not **or if there is no language tag at all** it skips the whole concept:  def get_concept_labels(self, concept, label_types, language): return [str(label) for label_type in label_types for label in self.graph.objects(concept, label_type) if label.language == language]   @property def subjects(self): for concept in self.concepts: labels = self.get_concept_labels( concept, [SKOS.prefLabel, RDFS.label], self.language) notation = self.graph.value(concept, SKOS.notation, None, any=True) if not labels: continue label = labels[0] if notation is not None: notation = str(notation) yield Subject(uri=str(concept), label=label, notation=notation, text=None)  I think, that maybe it would be safer to assume, that when there is no explicit information about the language in SKOS file (there is a label without the language tag), its language corresponds with the language defined in projects.cfg and skip a concept (or label from the concept) only when the language tag truly exists and is not equal to the language from projects.cfg. If this change is not possible for some reasons, it would be nice to provide some information about this behaviour in annif wiki (it took me some time to find this ""bug"").

470,Annif,https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/issues/470,NN ensemble may return scores above 1.0,"The NN ensemble doesn't always return scores in the range 0.0-1.0. For example, the `yso-sv` model currently available in Finto AI returns this for the input text `historia`: js { ""results"": [ { ""label"": ""historia"", ""notation"": null, ""score"": 1.3140300512313843, ""uri"": ""http://www.yso.fi/onto/yso/p1780"" }, [] }  This should be avoided, for example by capping the scores to 1.0.",test-file | source-file
187,Annif,https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/issues/187,Improved error handling,"There are many ways to trigger an error using Annif. These include * defining a project with missing settings (e.g. vocab is now practically mandatory) * trying to load documents before loading a vocabulary * trying to analyze documents before loading a vocabulary or training the model Some of these may also be triggered via the REST API, especially the last one. In these situations Annif should output a helpful error message instead of crashing with a traceback.",documentation-file | source-file

It seems plausible that due to its lexical approach, Maui uses the object literal as a unique value, which would match two topic URIs, given the above statements. The (albeit strangely truncated) concatenation of these two URI values are then returned in the response. This theory is currently being tested.  Proposed resolution Ideally, Annif could extract valid URIs from the invalid response, but this may be too much overhead if each response URI must be validated. At a minimum, Annif should ignore the malformed response and continue with eg. a warning statement on STDERR.",test-file | source-file
