429,hydrus,https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus/issues/429,demo returns incomplete contexts,"I'm submitting a - [X] bug report.  Current Behaviour: I'm exploring the hydrus demo to understand how Hydra works. From what I understand, the linked JSON-LD contexts do not provide enough information to parse a response as RDF. Requesting the `DroneCollection` returns the following JSON-LD document: jsonc // GET http://localhost:8080/serverapi/DroneCollection { ""@context"": ""/serverapi/contexts/DroneCollection.jsonld"", ""@id"": ""/serverapi/DroneCollection/"", ""@type"": ""DroneCollection"", ""members"": [], ""search"": { ""@type"": ""IriTemplate"", ""mapping"": [ { ""@type"": ""IriTemplateMapping"", ""property"": ""http://auto.schema.org/speed"", ""required"": false, ""variable"": ""DroneState[Speed]"" }, //  ], ""template"": ""/serverapi/Drone(DroneState[Speed], DroneState[Position], DroneState[Direction], DroneState[Battery], DroneState[SensorStatus], DroneState[DroneID], name, model, MaxSpeed, Sensor, pageIndex, limit, offset)"", ""variableRepresentation"": ""hydra:BasicRepresentation"" }, ""totalItems"": 0, ""view"": { ""@id"": ""/serverapi/DroneCollection?page=1"", ""@type"": ""PartialCollectionView"", ""first"": ""/serverapi/DroneCollection?page=1"", ""last"": ""/serverapi/DroneCollection?page=1"" } }  However, the linked JSON-LD context does not contain mappings for all the Hydra-specific identifiers: jsonc // GET http://localhost:8080/serverapi/contexts/DroneCollection.jsonld { ""@context"": { ""Drone"": ""vocab:Drone"", ""DroneCollection"": ""vocab:DroneCollection"", ""hydra"": ""http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#"", ""members"": ""http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#member"", ""vocab"": ""http://localhost:8080/serverapi/vocab#"" } }  Almost none of the Hydra-identifiers in the response (`search`, `IriTemplate`, `totalItems`, `first`, `last`, etc.) can be mapped to their URIs. The issue becomes obvious, when you paste the JSON-LD along with the JSON-LD context into the JSON-LD playground: http://tinyurl.com/rrq6cc8  Expected Behaviour: Either the JSON-LD context maps all the identifiers to their URIs or the identifiers are prefixed with `hydra:` in the document. E.g. like this: jsonc { ""@context"": ""/serverapi/contexts/DroneCollection.jsonld"", ""@id"": ""/serverapi/DroneCollection/"", ""@type"": ""DroneCollection"", ""members"": [], ""hydra:search"": { ""@type"": ""hydra:IriTemplate"", ""hydra:mapping"": [ { ""@type"": ""hydra:IriTemplateMapping"", ""hydra:property"": ""http://auto.schema.org/speed"", ""hydra:required"": false, ""hydra:variable"": ""DroneState[Speed]"" }, //  ], ""hydra:template"": ""/serverapi/Drone(DroneState[Speed], DroneState[Position], DroneState[Direction], DroneState[Battery], DroneState[SensorStatus], DroneState[DroneID], name, model, MaxSpeed, Sensor, pageIndex, limit, offset)"", ""hydra:variableRepresentation"": ""hydra:BasicRepresentation"" }, ""hydra:totalItems"": 0, ""hydra:view"": { ""@id"": ""/serverapi/DroneCollection?page=1"", ""@type"": ""hydra:PartialCollectionView"", ""hydra:first"": ""/serverapi/DroneCollection?page=1"", ""hydra:last"": ""/serverapi/DroneCollection?page=1"" } }  Here's the JSON-LD playground for this document: http://tinyurl.com/r2oje6q The same applies to other responses, e.g. the `Drone` representation, which links to the same JSON-LD context as the collection leaving `MaxSpeed`, `Sensor`, `model` and `name` undefined: jsonc // GET http://localhost:8080/serverapi/DroneCollection/9299bee8-bdc6-4d6f-9f48-f5884b3ef29c { ""@context"": ""/serverapi/contexts/DroneCollection.jsonld"", ""@id"": ""/serverapi/DroneCollection/9299bee8-bdc6-4d6f-9f48-f5884b3ef29c"", ""@type"": ""Drone"", ""MaxSpeed"": ""100"", ""Sensor"": ""Temperature"", ""model"": ""xyz"", ""name"": ""Drone 1"" }   Steps to reproduce: - Start the demo according to README - Authenticate - `GET http://localhost:8080/serverapi/DroneCollection` - `GET http://localhost:8080/serverapi/contexts/DroneCollection.jsonld` - Copy/paste both, document and context, into the JSON-LD playground (or click link above)  Do you want to work on this issue? no, I'm not familiar with python and only wanted to learn about Hydra.",source-file | data-file | test-file
462,hydrus,https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus/issues/462,Possible mistake while refactoring,"I'm submitting a - [x] bug report. - [ ] feature request.  Current Behaviour: <!-- Describe about the bug --> @xadahiya I came across this while I was refactoring hydrus. I am referencing the commit https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus/commit/c0b492982b7093b38084d59afcfbbc52bb73d5e5#diff-57bc8a5a89375175a4bf37d573213377R353 (by @de-sh )which is already merged. In the changes to `hydrus/resources.py` under the POST method of the Item Collection class, line 353 the change made is  headers_ = [{""Location"": get_hydrus_server_url() + get_api_name() + ""/"" + path + ""/""}]  to  headers_ = [{""Location"": ""{}/{}/"".format(get_hydrus_server_url(),get_api_name(),path)}]   Expected Behaviour: <!-- Describe what will happen if bug is removed --> I think that there has been a mistake while refactoring as the `path` variable is not correctly used in the newly formated string. I think it should be (notice the extra `{}` in the string formating.  headers_ = [{""Location"": ""{}{}/{}/"".format(get_hydrus_server_url(),get_api_name(),path)}]   Steps to reproduce: <!-- If you can then please provide the steps to reproduce the bug -->  Do you want to work on this issue? <!-- yes/no --> Yes",source-file | data-file
182,hydrus,https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus/issues/182,Port number is not specified for server endpoint URL,I'm submitting a - [x] bug report.  Current Behaviour: The port number is not specified for the API endpoint URL the server is exposed to. It may lead to a scenario where the client is unable to find the server or try to access a different program in the host machine.  Expected Behaviour: The port number of the server endpoint should be specified in the server URL so that client is able to connect to the server without any errors.  Steps to reproduce: - Run an instance of the hydrus server any port (the default `8080` also works) - Access it using a hydra enabled client with specifying the port number (e.g `http:127.0.0.1:8080/localhost` - It will not be able to find the rest of the resources apart from that which is present at `http:127.0.0.1:8080/localhost`  Do you want to work on this issue? yes,source-file
